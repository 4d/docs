- If you want to discover 4D, click on the **free trial** link. You will be only asked to sign in or to create a 4D account.
- If you already have a 4D account, click **Sign in** in the upper right of the dialog and enter your account information. If you have purchased 4D licenses, they are automatically downloaded and installed on your machine.

Deploy the **Launching applications** area and select what you want to do:

- **Connect to 4D Server** - use 4D as a remote client and connect to an application that is already loaded by 4D Server.
- **Open a local application** - load an existing application stored on your disk.
- **Create a new application** - create a new, empty application project on your disk. 

Enjoy your 4D experience!
