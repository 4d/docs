A 4D component is a set of 4D code and/or 4D forms representing one or more functionalities that you can add and use in your projects. For example, the 4D SVG component adds advanced commands and an integrated rendering engine that can be used to display SVG files.

## Loading components

To load a component in your 4D project, you just need to:

1. Reference the component name in the **dependencies.json** file of your 4D project. This file must be saved in the **Sources** folder of the 4D project folder, e.g.:
	```
	/MyProjectRoot/Project/Sources/dependencies.json 
	```
2. Copy the component's package folder (*i.e.* the project root folder of the component) at the same level as your 4D project, e.g.:
	```
	/MyProjectRoot/
	/MyProjectComponentRoot/ 
	```

You can easily copy all your components in the same folder and reference them in your `dependencies.json` files.
