Database projects are deployed through .4DZ files. A .4DZ file is basically a zipped version of the [project folder](architecture.md). Compact and with an optimized size, .4DZ project files can be easily deployed. 

.4DZ files can be used by:

- 4D Server
- 4D Volume license (merged applications)
- 4D Developer

.4DZ files are generated by the build application feature (Application builder dialog box or ```BUILD APPLICATION``` command).
