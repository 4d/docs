title: Deploying a project

A database project is deployed via a single packed .4dz file. A .4dz file is essentially a zipped version of the [project folder](architecture.md). Compact and with an optimized size, .4dz project files can be easily deployed. 

.4dz files can be used by:

- 4D Server
- 4D Volume license (merged applications)
- 4D Developer

.4dz files are generated by the build application feature (Application builder dialog box or [BUILD APPLICATION](https://livedoc.4d.com/4D-Language-Reference-18/4D-Environment/BUILD-APPLICATION.301-4505371.en.html) command).
