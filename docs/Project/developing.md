## Development tools


You create and develop a 4D database project locally, using the **4D Developer** application. To open a project from 4D Developer, you select the project's main file, named *databaseName.4DProject* (see [Architecture of a 4D project](architecture.md)). Note that you can also work with any text editor since most of 4D project files are text files. Concurrent file accesses are handled (see below). 

4D Server can open *databaseName.4DProject* files for testing purposes: remote 4D machines can connect and use the database, but all database structure files are read-only. 

Multi-user development is managed through standard source control tools, which allow developers to work on different branches, and compare, merge, or revert modifications. 

### Deployment

Database projects are deployed through .4DZ files. A .4DZ file is basically a zipped version of the project folder. Compact and with an optimized size, .4DZ project files can be easily deployed. 

.4DZ files can be used by:

- 4D Server
- 4D Volume license (merged applications)
- 4D Developer

.4DZ files are generated by the build application feature (Application builder dialog box or ```BUILD APPLICATION``` command). 


## Project file access

When working on a project in 4D Developer, you use 4D built-in editors to create, modify, or save structure items, methods, forms, etc. Since editors actually use files on disk, potential conflicts could happen if the same file is modified or even deleted from different locations. For example, if the same method is edited in a method editor window and in a text editor, saving modifications will result in a conflict.

The 4D Developer framework includes a file access manager that controls concurrent accesses:

- if you open a file which is read-only at the OS level, a locked icon is displayed in the editor:
![](../assets/en/lockicon.png)  

- if an open file is edited concurrently, 4D displays an alert dialog box when trying to save the changes:
![](../assets/en/projectReload.png)  
	- **Yes**: discard editor changes and reload
	- **No**: save changes and overwrite the other version
	- **Cancel**: do not save

This feature is enabled for all built-in editors:

- structure editor
- form editor
- method editor
- settings editor
- toolbox editor
