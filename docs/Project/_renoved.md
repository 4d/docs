## One 4D, two development modes

Developing a 4D application can be done in two different modes:

- **binary mode**: all design elements (methods, forms, structure...) are gathered in a single, compact binary file, the ".4db" file. This mode was the only available mode until 4D v18.
- **project mode**: all design elements are stored in separate, text-based, human-readable files.
