A 4D project is a 4D application where all the development is stored into several text-based, human-readable files.

Fully functional 4D applications are created from end-to-end via multiple files within a single 4D project. These files contain everything from the structure of an application, to its code, and even the applicationâ€™s settings and user preferences.
 
Because file formats in projects are in plain text (JSON, XML, etc.), they are easy to read and understand by both new and experienced developers. Their compact size increases opportunities to work collaboratively by being easy to:

- Program generically
- Customize code
- Share files
- Create templates

The flexibility of developing a 4D project is especially demonstrated when multiple developers need to work on the same part of an application, at the same time. 4D Project files are ideal for defining modules and storing them in a source control repository (Perforce, Git, SVN, etc.), allowing development teams to take advantage of features such as: 

- Versioning
- Revision Comparisons
- Rollbacks

To create a 4D project, you have two possibilities:

- create a new, empty project
- export an existing 4D "binary" development -- which can require adaptations to handle compatibility issues. 

4D project-based applications can be compiled and easily deployed in single-user or client/server architecture through compressed files.
