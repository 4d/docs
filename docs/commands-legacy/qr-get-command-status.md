#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.QR Get command status.Summary-->The **QR Get command status** command returns 0 if the *command* is disabled or 1 if it is enabled.<!-- END REF-->

*value* returns the value of the selected sub-item, if any. For example, if the command that was selected is the **Font** menu (1000) and the font selected was “Arial”, *value* would return “Arial”, or if the command that was selected is a color menu (1002, 1003 or 1004), *value* would return the color number.

You can use the command in two types of contexts:

* As a simple statement to determine whether a command is enabled or disabled.
* In the method installed by [QR ON COMMAND](qr-on-command.md), to allow you to know which sub-item was selected. In that method, *$1* is the reference of the area and *$2* is the number of the command.

In *command*, you can pass a value or one of the constants of the *QR Commands* constant theme.

If you pass an invalid *area* number, the error -9850 will be generated.  
If you pass an invalid *command* number, the error -9852 will be generated.
