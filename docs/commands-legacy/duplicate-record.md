#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.DUPLICATE RECORD.Summary-->**DUPLICATE RECORD** creates a new record for *aTable* that is a duplicate of the current record.<!-- END REF--> The new record becomes the current record. If there is no current record, then **DUPLICATE RECORD** does nothing. You must use [SAVE RECORD](save-record.md) to save the new record.

**DUPLICATE RECORD** can be executed during data entry. This allows you to create a clone of the currently displayed record. Remember that you must first execute [SAVE RECORD](save-record.md) in order to save any changes made to the original record. 

**Compatibility note:** Beginning with version 11 of 4D, this command no longer supports subtables.
