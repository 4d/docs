#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.GRAPH SETTINGS.Summary-->GRAPH SETTINGS changes the graph settings for graph displayed in a form.<!-- END REF--> The graph must have already been defined using the [GRAPH](graph.md) command. GRAPH SETTINGS has no effect on a pie chart. This command must be called in the same process as the form.

**Note:** You must not call this command if the graph was generated using the [GRAPH](graph.md) command with the [Object](# "Data structured as a native 4D object") type *graphSettings* parameter. Refer to the description of the [GRAPH](graph.md) command for more information.

The *xmin*, *xmax*, *ymin*, and *ymax* parameters all set the minimum and maximum values for their respective axes of the graph. If the value of any pair of these parameters is a null value (0, ?00:00:00?, or !00/00/00!, depending on the data type), the default graph values will be used. The *xmin* and *xmax* parameters are only taken into account for proportional graphs (*xprop* is **True**).

The *xprop* parameter turns on proportional plotting for line graphs (type 4), area graphs (type 5) and scatter graphs (type 6). When TRUE, it will plot each point on the x-axis according to the pointâ€™s value, and then only if the values are numeric, time, or date.

The *xgrid* and *ygrid* parameters display or hide grid lines. A grid for the x-axis will be displayed only when the plot is a proportional scatter or line graph.

The *title* parameter(s) labels the legend.

#### Example 

See example for the [GRAPH](graph.md) command.
