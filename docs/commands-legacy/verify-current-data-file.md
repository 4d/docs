#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.VERIFY CURRENT DATA FILE.Summary-->The VERIFY CURRENT DATA FILE command carries out a structural check of the objects found in the data file currently opened by 4D.<!-- END REF-->

This command has the same functioning as the [VERIFY DATA FILE](verify-data-file.md) command, except that it only applies to the current data file of the open database. It therefore does not require parameters specifying the structure and data.

Refer to the [VERIFY DATA FILE](verify-data-file.md) command for a description of the parameters.

If you pass the VERIFY CURRENT DATA FILE command with no parameters, the verification is carried out with the default values of the parameters:

* *objects* \= Verify All (= value 16)
* *options* \= 0 (log file is created but not timestamped)
* *method* \= ""
* *tablesArray* and *fieldsArray* are omitted.

When this command is executed, the data cache is flushed and all operations accessing the data are blocked during the verification.

If a log file has been generated, its complete pathname is returned in the *Document* system variable. 

#### System variables and sets 

If the callback method does not exist, the verification is not carried out, an error is generated and the system variable OK is set to 0\. If a log file was generated, its complete pathname is returned in the Document system variable.
