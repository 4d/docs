| Parameter | Type |  | Description |

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CUT NAMED SELECTION.Summary-->**CUT NAMED SELECTION** creates a named selection *name* and moves the current selection of *aTable* to it.<!-- END REF--> This command differs from [COPY NAMED SELECTION](copy-named-selection.md) in that it does not copy the current selection, but moves the current selection of *table* itself.

After the command has been executed, the current selection of *aTable* in the current process becomes empty. Therefore, **CUT NAMED SELECTION** should not be used while a record is being modified.

**CUT NAMED SELECTION** is more memory efficient than [COPY NAMED SELECTION](copy-named-selection.md). With [COPY NAMED SELECTION](copy-named-selection.md), 4 bytes times the number of selected records is duplicated in memory. With **CUT NAMED SELECTION**, only the reference to the list is moved.

#### Example 

The following method empties the current selection of a table *\[Customers\]*:

```4d
 CUT NAMED SELECTION([Customers];"ToBeCleared")
 CLEAR NAMED SELECTION("ToBeCleared")
```
