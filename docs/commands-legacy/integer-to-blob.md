#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.INTEGER TO BLOB.Summary-->The INTEGER TO BLOB command writes the 2-byte Integer value *integer* into the BLOB *blob*.<!-- END REF-->

The *byteOrder* parameter fixes the byte ordering of the 2-byte Integer value to be written. You pass one of the following predefined constants provided by 4D:

| Constant                | Type    | Value |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Macintosh byte ordering | Longint | 1     |
| Native byte ordering    | Longint | 0     |
| PC byte ordering        | Longint | 2     |

**Note regarding Platform Independence:** If you exchange BLOBs between the Macintosh and PC platforms, it is up to you to manage byte swapping issues when using this command.

If you specify the \* optional parameter, the 2-byte Integer value is appended to the BLOB and the size of the BLOB is extended accordingly. Using the \* optional parameter, you can sequentially store any number of Integer, Long Integer, Real or Text values (see other BLOB commands) in a BLOB, as long as the BLOB fits into memory. 

If you do not specify the \* optional parameter or the *offset* variable parameter, the 2-byte Integer value is stored at the beginning of the BLOB, overriding its previous contents; the size of the BLOB is adjusted accordingly.

If you pass the *offset* variable parameter, the 2-byte Integer value is written at the byte offset (starting from zero) within the BLOB. No matter where you write the 2-byte Integer value, the size of the BLOB is increased according to the location you passed (plus up to 2 bytes, if necessary). Newly allocated bytes, other than the ones you are writing, are initialized to zero.

After the call, the *offset* variable parameter is returned, incremented by the number of bytes that have been written. Therefore, you can reuse that same variable with another BLOB writing command to write another value.

##### Note 

**Compatiblity note:** Since this command alters the blob passed as a parameter, it does not support blob objects (4D.Blob type). See *Passing blobs and blob objects to 4D commands* on developer.4d.com.

#### Example 1 

After executing this code:

```4d
 SET BLOB SIZE(vxBlob;100)
 vlOffset:=50
 INTEGER TO BLOB(518;vxBlob;Macintosh byte ordering;vlOffset)
```

* The size of *vxBlob* is 100 bytes
* On all platforms *vxBLOB{50}* \= *$02* and *vxBLOB{51}* \= *$06*
* The other bytes of the BLOB are left unchanged
* The variable *vlOffset* has been incremented by 2 (and is now equal to 52)

#### Example 2 

After executing this code:

```4d
 INTEGER TO BLOB(0x0206;vxBlob;PC byte ordering)
```

* The size of *vxBlob* is 2 bytes
* On all platforms *vxBLOB{0}* \= *$06* and *vxBLOB{1}* \= *$02*

#### Example 3 

After executing this code:

```4d
 SET BLOB SIZE(vxBlob;100)
 INTEGER TO BLOB(0x0206;vxBlob;PC byte ordering;*)
```

* The size of *vxBlob* is 102 bytes
* On all platforms *vxBLOB{100}* \= *$06* and *vxBLOB{101}* \= *$02*
* The other bytes of the BLOB are left unchanged

#### Example 4 

After executing this code:

```4d
 INTEGER TO BLOB(0x0206;vxBlob;Native byte ordering)
```

* The size of *vxBlob* is 2 bytes
* On PowerPC platform: *vxBLOB{0}* \= *$02* and *vxBLOB{1}* \= *$06*
* On Intel platform: *vxBLOB{0}* \= *$06* and *vxBLOB{1}* \= *$02*

#### Example 5 

After executing this code:

```4d
 INTEGER TO BLOB(0x0206;vxBlob;Macintosh byte ordering)
```

* The size of *vxBlob* is 2 bytes
* On all platforms *vxBLOB{0}* \= *$02* and *vxBLOB{1}* \= *$06*
