#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET TEXT ORIENTATION.Summary-->The **OBJECT SET TEXT ORIENTATION** command modifies the orientation of the object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters for the current process.<!-- END REF-->

The "Orientation" property, available in the Form editor, performs permanent rotations of text areas in your forms. Unlike this property, the **OBJECT SET TEXT ORIENTATION** command applies the rotation to the contents of the object, but not to the object itself. For more information, refer to the *Design Reference* manual.

 Passing the optional *\** parameter indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, it indicates that the *object* parameter is a field or variable. In this case, you pass a field or variable reference instead of a string (field or variable object only).   
Only static text as well as non-enterable variables and fields can be rotated. If you apply this command to an object that does not support text orientation, the command does nothing. 

In the *orientation* parameter, you pass the absolute orientation that you want to assign to the object. You must use one of the following constants, found in the "*Form Objects (Properties)*" theme:

| Constant              | Type    | Value | Comment                                      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Orientation 0°        | Longint | 0     | No rotation (default value)                  |
| Orientation 180°      | Longint | 180   | Orientation of text to 180° clockwise        |
| Orientation 90° left  | Longint | 270   | Orientation of text to 90° counter-clockwise |
| Orientation 90° right | Longint | 90    | Orientation of text to 90° clockwise         |

**Note:** Only angles corresponding to these values are supported. If you pass any other value, it will be ignored. 

#### Example 

You want to apply an orientation of 270° to a variable in your form: 

```4d
 OBJECT SET ENTERABLE(*;"myVar";False)
  // mandatory if variable is enterable
 OBJECT SET TEXT ORIENTATION(*;"myVar";Orientation 90° left)
```
