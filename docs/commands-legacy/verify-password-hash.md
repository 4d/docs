<!--REF #_command_.Verify password hash.Syntax-->**Verify password hash** ( *password* ; *hash* ) : Boolean<!-- END REF-->
<!--REF #_command_.Verify password hash.Params-->
| Parameter | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| password | Text | &#8594;  | The user's password.  Only the first 72 characters are used. |
| hash | Text | &#8594;  | A password hash. |
| Function result | Boolean | &#8592; | Returns TRUE if the password and hash match, otherwise returns FALSE. |

<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Verify password hash.Summary-->The **Verify password hash** function verifies that the given *hash* matches the given *password*.<!-- END REF-->

This function compares *password* to a *hash* generated by the [Generate password hash](generate-password-hash.md) function.

##### Error management 

The following errors may be returned. You can review an error with the [Last errors](last-errors.md)  and [ON ERR CALL](on-err-call.md) commands.  

| **Number** | **Message**                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 850        | Password-hash: Unsupported algorithm.     |
| 851        | Password-hash: Consistency check failure. |

**Reminder:** Only bcrypt algorithm is supported. If your hash was not generated using bcrypt, an error is returned. 

#### Example 

This example verifies a password hash previously created by [Generate password hash](generate-password-hash.md) and stored in a \[Users\] table with a newly entered password:

```4d
 var $password : Text
 $password:=Request("Please enter your password")
 
 If(Verify password hash($password;[Users]hash))
    ALERT("Good password")
 Else
    ALERT("Password error")
 End if
```

**Note:** The password is never stored on disk, only the hash. Using a remote 4D application, the hash could be produced on the client side. If instead, you use a JavaScript (or similar) based front end, the best practice for security is to create the hash on the server side. Of course, you should use a TLS encrypted network connection for security, as this requires transferring the password over the network.
