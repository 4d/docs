#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.GET RELATION PROPERTIES.Summary-->The GET RELATION PROPERTIES command returns the properties of the relation (if any) which starts from the source field defined by *tableNum* and *fieldNum* or by *fieldPtr*.<!-- END REF-->

You can pass:

* Either table and field numbers in *tableNum* and *fieldNum*,
* Or a pointer to the field in *fieldPtr*.

Once the command has been executed:

* The *oneTable* and *oneField* parameters contain respectively the table and field number to which the relation (from the source field) is pointing. If there is no relation starting from the field, these parameters return 0.
* The *choicefield* parameter contains the choice field number (from the target table) defined within this relation. If no choice field has been set for this relation, or if no relation starts from the source field, this parameter returns 0.
* The *autoOne* and *autoMany* parameters return **True** if, respectively, the “Auto Relate One” and “Auto One to Many” boxes has been checked for this relation; otherwise, they return **False**.

**Note:** The *autoOne* and *autoMany* parameters will also return **True** if no relation starts from the source field (in this case they return non-significant values). The value of both the *oneTable* and *oneField* parameters allows you to make sure that a relation exists.
