<!--REF #_command_.Get picture file name.Summary-->The **Get picture file name** command returns the current default name of the picture passed as parameter.<!-- END REF-->

The default name is used when exporting the picture to a disk file. It can be set automatically based on the original name of the picture file imported into the picture field or variable, or using the [SET PICTURE FILE NAME](set-picture-file-name.md) command. For more information, refer to the *Design Reference* manual. 

If the picture does not have a default name, the command returns an empty string.
