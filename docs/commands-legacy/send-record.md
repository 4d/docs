<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SEND RECORD.Summary-->**SEND RECORD** sends the current record of *aTable* to the serial port or document opened by the [SET CHANNEL](set-channel.md) command.<!-- END REF--> The record is sent with a special internal format that can be read only by [RECEIVE RECORD](receive-record.md). If no current record exists, SEND RECORD has no effect.

The complete record is sent. This means that pictures and BLOBs stored in or with the record are also sent.

**Important:** When records are being sent and received using SEND RECORD and [RECEIVE RECORD](receive-record.md), the source table structure and the destination table structure must be compatible. If they are not, 4D will convert values according to the table definitions when [RECEIVE RECORD](receive-record.md) is executed.

**Note:** If you send a record to a document using this command, the document must have been opened using the [SET CHANNEL](set-channel.md) command. You cannot use SEND RECORD with a document opened with [Open document](open-document.md), [Create document](create-document.md) or [Append document](append-document.md).

**Compatibility note:** Beginning with version 11 of 4D, this command no longer supports subtables.

#### Example 

See example for the [RECEIVE RECORD](receive-record.md) command.
