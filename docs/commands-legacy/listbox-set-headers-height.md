#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.LISTBOX SET HEADERS HEIGHT.Summary-->The **LISTBOX SET HEADERS HEIGHT** command modifies by programming the height of the header row in the list box designated by the *object* and *\** parameters.<!-- END REF-->

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, this indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (a string). If you do not pass this parameter, this indicates that the *object* is a variable. In this case, you pass a variable reference instead of a string. 

You can designate either the list box or any header of the list box.

Pass the height to set in the *height* parameter. By default, if you omit the *unit* parameter, this height is expressed in pixels. To change the unit, you can pass one of the following constants (found in the *List Box* theme), in the *unit* parameter:

| Constant  | Type    | Value | Comment                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lk lines  | Longint | 1     | Height is expressed as a number of lines. 4D calculates the height of a line according to the font. |
| lk pixels | Longint | 0     | Height is expressed as a number of pixels (default).                                                |

Headers must respect the minimum height set by the system. This height is 24 pixels under Windows and 17 pixels under Mac OS. If you pass a lower value in the *height* parameter, the minimum height is applied. 

**Note:** For more information about calculation row heights, refer to the *Design Reference* manual.
