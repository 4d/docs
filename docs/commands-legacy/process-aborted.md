This status will happen very rarely. Processes are usually stopped before the code can be notified the "process aborted" condition. This condition might only happen in compiled loops not executing any 4D command. For more infomation about how 4D handles the closure of processes, please refer to the [On Exit database method](on-exit-database-method.md) page.
