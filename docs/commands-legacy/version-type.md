#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Version type.Summary-->The Version type command returns a numeric value that denotes the type of 4D or 4D Server version that you are running.<!-- END REF--> 4D provides the following predefined constants, found in the *4D Environment* theme:

| Constant           | Type    | Value | Comment                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 64 bit version     | Longint | 1     |                                                         |
| Demo version       | Longint | 0     |                                                         |
| Merged application | Longint | 2     | Version is an application merged with 4D Volume Desktop |

**Note:** In current versions of 4D, the demo mode is not available.

Version type returns a value in the form of a *bit field*; it is necessary to use bitwise operators to interpret it (see the example).

#### Example 

This test lets you run different code depending on whether the version is a merged application or a database opened by 4D / 4D Server:

```4d
 If(Version type?? Merged application)
  // We are in a merged application
 Else
  // We are in a database executed by 4D
 End if
```
