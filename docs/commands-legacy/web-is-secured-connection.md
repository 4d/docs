#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.WEB Is secured connection.Summary-->The **WEB Is secured connection** command returns a Boolean indicating if the 4D Web server connection was done in secured mode through TLS/SSL (the request starts with “https:” instead of “http:”).<!-- END REF-->

* If the connection is made through TLS or SSL, the function returns True.
* If the connection is made in a non-secured mode, the function returns False.

**Note:** For more information on the TLS protocol, refer to the [WEB SERVICE SET PARAMETER](web-service-set-parameter.md) section. 

This command allows, for example, denying connections made in a non-secured mode (if any).
