## Description 

<!--REF #_command_.START TRANSACTION.Summary-->START TRANSACTION starts a [transaction](../Develop-legacy/transactions.md) in the current process.<!-- END REF--> All changes to the data (records) of the database within the transaction are stored temporarily until the transaction is accepted (validated) or canceled.

You can nest several transactions (sub-transactions). Each transaction or sub-transaction must eventually be cancelled or validated. Note that if the main transaction is cancelled, all the sub-transactions are cancelled as well, regardless of their result.
