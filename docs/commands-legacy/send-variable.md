#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SEND VARIABLE.Summary-->SEND VARIABLE sends *variable* to the document or serial port previously opened by [SET CHANNEL](set-channel.md).<!-- END REF--> The variable is sent with a special internal format that can be read only by [RECEIVE VARIABLE](receive-variable.md). SEND VARIABLE sends the complete variable (including its type and value).

**Notes:**

1. If you send a variable to a document using this command, the document must have been opened using the [SET CHANNEL](set-channel.md) command. You cannot use SEND VARIABLE with a document opened with [Open document](open-document.md), [Create document](create-document.md) or [Append document](append-document.md).
2. This command does not support array variables. If you want to send and receive arrays from a document or over a serial port, use the *BLOB Commands*.

#### Example 

See example for the [RECEIVE RECORD](receive-record.md) command.
