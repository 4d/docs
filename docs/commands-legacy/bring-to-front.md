<!-- END REF-->

*This command is not thread-safe, it cannot be used in preemptive code.*


#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.BRING TO FRONT.Summary-->**BRING TO FRONT** brings all the windows belonging to *process* to the front.<!-- END REF--> If the process is already the frontmost process, the command does nothing. If the process is hidden, you must use [SHOW PROCESS](show-process.md) to display the process, otherwise **BRING TO FRONT** has no effect.

The Main and Design processes can be brought to the front using this command.

**Note:** When the process contains several windows and you want to pass a specific one to the front, it is preferable to use, for example, the [SET WINDOW RECT](set-window-rect.md) command. 

#### Example 

The following example is a method that can be executed from a menu. It checks to see if *◊vlAddCust\_PID* is the frontmost process. If not, the method brings it to the front:

```4d
 If(Frontmost process#◊vlAddCust_PID)
    BRING TO FRONT(◊vlAddCust_PID)
 End if
```
