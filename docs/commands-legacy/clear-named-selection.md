#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CLEAR NAMED SELECTION.Summary-->**CLEAR NAMED SELECTION** clears *name* from memory and frees the memory used by *name*.<!-- END REF--> The command does not affect tables, selections, or records. Since named selections use memory, it is good practice to clear named selections when they are no longer needed.

If *name* was created using the [CUT NAMED SELECTION](cut-named-selection.md) command and then manipulated using the [USE NAMED SELECTION](use-named-selection.md) command, *name* no longer exists in memory. In this case, the **CLEAR NAMED SELECTION** command does not need to be used.
