<!--REF #_command_.SET USER ALIAS.Syntax-->**SET USER ALIAS** ( *alias* )<!-- END REF-->
<!--REF #_command_.SET USER ALIAS.Params-->
| Parameter | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| alias | Text | &#8594;  | Alternate user name for 4D user account or "" to reset |

<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SET USER ALIAS.Summary-->The **SET USER ALIAS** command defines an alternate, custom name to use in place of the current 4D user account name for the current session.<!-- END REF--> The alternate name is retained in memory and applied only to the current user. 

**Note:** This command can only be called from 4D remote or 4D single-user applications. It is not allowed on 4D Server. 

In the *alias* parameter, pass the alternate name to be displayed instead of the current 4D user account name. 

Once the command is executed, the *alias* is used wherever the current 4D user account was returned or displayed, in particular in the [Current user](current-user.md), [Get process activity](get-process-activity.md) and [LOCKED BY](locked-by.md) commands, or the [ORDER BY FORMULA](order-by-formula.md) of the 4D Server administration window. In client/server environments, this command must be executed on remote applications so that each user is identified on the server, for example through the [Current user](current-user.md) command, even if all remote applications use the same 4D user account.

To remove the *alias* for the current 4D user, call **SET USER ALIAS**("").

**Note:** Calling the [CHANGE CURRENT USER](change-current-user.md) command resets the alias name for the current user. 

#### Example 

Your users are managed through a custom table and use the same 4D user account. On each client machine, you can execute:

```4d
Â SET USER ALIAS([myUsers]userName)
```
