#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.PUSH RECORD.Summary-->**PUSH RECORD** pushes the current record of *aTable* (and its subrecords, if any) onto the table’s record stack.<!-- END REF--> **PUSH RECORD** may be executed before a record is saved.

If you push a record that was unlocked, this record stays locked for all the other processes and users until you pop and unload it.

**Compatibility note:** Beginning with version 11 of 4D, this command no longer supports subtables. 

#### Example 

The following example pushes the record for the customer onto the record stack:

```4d
 PUSH RECORD([Customer]) // Push customer’s record onto stack
```
