#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Count user processes.Summary-->Count user processes returns the current number of "live" processes in the 4D application whose type is different from -25 (Internal Timer Process), -31 (Client Manager Process) and -15 (Server Interface Process).<!-- END REF--> For more information about process types, please refer to the [Process info](../commands/process-info.md) command and to the *Process Type* constants theme. 

The Count user processes function returns the number of processes opened directly or indirectly by the user (processes for which the *origin* parameter returned by the [Process info](../commands/process-info.md) command is greater than or equal to 0). 

**Note:** The "live" processes are processes whose status is neither *aborted*, nor *does not exist* (see the [Process state](process-state.md) command).
