#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CREATE RELATED ONE.Summary-->**CREATE RELATED ONE** performs two actions.<!-- END REF--> If a related record does not exist for *aField* (that is, if a match is not found for the current value of *field*), **CREATE RELATED ONE** creates a new related record. 

To save a value in the appropriate field, assign values to the One field from the Many field. Call [SAVE RELATED ONE](save-related-one.md) to save the new record.

If a related record exists, **CREATE RELATED ONE** acts just like [RELATE ONE](relate-one.md) and loads the related record into memory.
