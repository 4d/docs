#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.EXECUTE METHOD.Summary-->The EXECUTE METHOD command executes the *methodName* project method while passing any parameters in *param1.<!-- END REF-->..paramN*. You can pass the name of any method that can be called from the database or the component executing the command.

In *result*, you can pass a variable which will receive the result of the execution of *methodName* (value placed in $0 inside *methodName*). If the method does not return a result, pass *\** as the second parameter. If the method does not return a result and does not require any parameters to be passed, pass only the *methodName* parameter.

The execution context is preserved in the called method, which means that the current form and any current form event remain defined. 

If you call this command from a component and pass a method name belonging to the host database in *methodName* (or vice versa), the method must have been shared (“Shared by components and host database” option, in the Method properties).

#### System variables and sets 

If this command is executed correctly, the system variable OK is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.
