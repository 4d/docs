#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.GET MOUSE.Summary-->The GET MOUSE command returns the current state of the mouse.<!-- END REF-->

The horizontal and vertical coordinates are returned in *mouseX* and *mouseY*. If you pass the *\** parameter, the coordinates are expressed relative to the main screen (macOS and Windows SDI mode) or to the application window (Windows MDI mode). If you omit the *\** parameter, they are expressed relative to the current form window (if any) of the current process.

The parameter *mouseButton* returns the state of the buttons, as listed previously.

**Note:** The values 2 and 3 can be returned under Mac OS X starting with version 10.2.5 only.
