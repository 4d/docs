| Web CORS enabled                         | 92    | **Scope:** Local Web server<br/>**Description:** CORS (*Cross-origin resource sharing*) service status for the Web server. If enabled, XHR (e.g. REST) calls from Web pages outside the domain can be allowed in your application. (**Note:** A list of addresses and methods allowed to use the CORS service must also be defined, see Web CORS settings). When the CORS service is disabled, CORS requests are ignored. When the CORS service is enabled and a non-allowed domain or method sends a cross site request, it is rejected with a "403 - forbidden" error response. **Possible values:** 0 (disabled, default) or 1 (enabled)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

When enabled, this file, named "**HTTPDebugLog\_*nn*.txt**", is stored in the "Logs" folder of the application (*nn* is the file number). It is useful for debugging issues related to the Web server. It records each request and each response in raw mode. Whole requests, including headers, are logged; optionally, body parts can be logged as well. For more information on the HTTPDebugLog files, please refer to the *Description of log files* section.<br/>**Values**: One of the constants prefixed with "wdl" (refer to the descriptions of these constants in this theme).<br/>**Default value**: 0 (not enabled)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Web HSTS enabled                         | 86    | **Scope**: 4D local, 4D Server. <br/>**Description**: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) status. HSTS allows the 4D Web server to declare that browsers should only interact with it via secure HTTPS connections. Once activated, the 4D Web server will automatically add HSTS-related information to all response headers. Browsers will record the HSTS information the first time they receive a response from the 4D Web server, then any future HTTP requests will automatically be transformed into HTTPS requests. The length of time this information is stored by the browser is specified with the Web HSTS max age selector. <br/> HSTS requires that HTTPS is enabled on the server. HTTP must also be enabled to allow client initial connections.<br/>**Possible values**: 0 (disabled, default) or 1 (enabled)<br/>**Note:** The 4D Web server must be restarted for this setting to be applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Web HTTP compression level               | 50    | **Scope**: Local Web server<br/>**Description**: Compression level for all compressed HTTP exchanges for the 4D HTTP server (client requests or server replies, Web and Web Service). This selector lets you optimize exchanges by either privileging speed of execution (less compression) or the amount of compression (less speed). The choice of a value depends on the size and type of data exchanged. Pass 1 to 9 in the *value* parameter where 1 is the fastest compression and 9 the highest. You can also pass -1 to get a compromise between speed and rate of compression. By default, the compression level is 1 (faster compression).<br/>**Possible values**: 1 to 9 (1 = faster, 9 = more compressed) or -1 = best compromise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If you use one of these formats without any of its fields having been selected on this page, the log file will not be generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Web max concurrent processes             | 18    | **Compatibility:** This selector is ignored when the Web scalable session mode is enabled.**<br/>** **Scope**: 4D local, 4D Server<br/>**Description**: Strictly upper limit of concurrent Web processes of any type supported by the 4D Web Server with 4D in local mode and 4D Server. When this number (minus one) is reached, 4D will not create any other processes and returns the HTTP status 503 - Service Unavailable to all new requests.<br/>This parameter can prevent the 4D Web Server from saturation, which can occur when an exceedingly large number of concurrent requests are sent, or when too many context creations are requested. This parameter can also be set in the Database settings.<br/>In theory, the maximum number of Web processes is the result of the following formula: Available memory/Web process stack size. Another solution is to view the information on Web processes displayed in the Runtime Explorer: the current number of Web processes and the maximum number reached since the Web server boot are indicated.<br/>**Possible values**: Any value between 10 and 32 000\. The default value is 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Web max sessions                         | 71    | **Scope**: Local Web server<br/>**Description**: Limits the number of simultaneous sessions. When you reach the limit set, the oldest session is closed (and *On Web Legacy Close Session database method* is called) if the Web server needs to create a new one.<br/>**Possible values**: Longint. The number of simultaneous sessions cannot exceed the total number of Web processes (Web Max Concurrent Processes option, 100 by default)<br/>**Default value**: 100 (pass 0 to restore the default value)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Web maximum requests size                | 27    | Scope: 4D local, 4D Server**<br/>** **Description**: Maximum size (in bytes) of incoming HTTP requests (POST) that the Web server is authorized to process. By default, the value is 2 000 000, i.e. a little less than 2 MB. Passing the maximum value (2 147 483 647) means that, in practice, no limit is set.<br/>This limit is used to avoid Web server saturation due to incoming requests that are too large. When a request reaches this limit, the 4D Web server refuses it.<br/>**Possible values**: 500 000 to 2 147 483 647.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Web port ID                              | 15    | **Scope**: 4D in local mode and 4D Server.<br/>**Description:**  Sets or gets the number of the TCP port used by the 4D Web server with 4D in local mode and 4D Server. By default, the value is 80\. The TCP port number is set on the "Web/Configuration" page of the Database Settings dialog box. You can use one of the constants in the *TCP Port Numbers* theme for the *value* parameter. This selector is useful within the framework of 4D Web servers that are compiled and merged using 4D Desktop (no access to the Design environment).<br/>**Possible values:** For more information about the TCP port number, refer to the *Web Server Settings* section.<br/>**Default value:** 80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This selector (as well as selector 81) is useful for controlling the scope of the session cookies: If you set, for example, the value "/4DACTION" for this selector, the client will only send a cookie for dynamic requests beginning with 4DACTION, and not for pictures, static pages, etc.<br/>**Possible values:** Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Web session enable IP address validation | 83    | **Scope**: Local Web server<br/>**Description**: Enables or disables IP address validation for session cookies. For security reasons, by default the 4D Web server checks the IP address of each request containing a session cookie and rejects it if this address does not match the IP address used to create the cookie. In some specific applications, you may want to disable this validation and accept session cookies, even when their IP addresses do not match. For example when mobile devices switch between Wifi and 3G/4G networks, their IP address will change. In this case, you must pass 0 in this option to allow clients to be able to continue using their Web sessions even when the IP addresses change. Note that this setting lowers the security level of your application. <br/>When it is modified, this setting is effective immediately (you do not need to restart the HTTP server).<br/>**Possible values**: 0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled)<br/>**Default value**: 1 (IP addresses are checked)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

When you use the Web debug log *selector*, you can receive one of the following constants in the *value* parameter:
