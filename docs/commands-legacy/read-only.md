#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.READ ONLY.Summary-->READ ONLY changes the state of *aTable* to read-only for the process in which it is called.<!-- END REF--> All subsequent records that are loaded are locked, and you cannot make any changes made to them. If the optional \* parameter is specified, all tables are changed to read-only state.

Use READ ONLY when you do not need to modify the record or records.

**Note:** This command is not retroactive. A record is loaded according to the tableâ€™s read/write status at the time of loading. To load a record from a read/write table in read-only mode, you must first change the table state to read-only.
