If the pasteboard contains enriched text (for example in RTF format), the text will keep its attributes when it is dropped or pasted, if the destination area is compatible. 

Note that 4D text fields and variables can contain up to 2 GB of text.

#### System variables and sets 

If the text is correctly extracted, OK is set to 1; otherwise OK is set to 0.
