| seconds | Integer | &#8594;  | Seconds until the timeout |

<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SET TIMEOUT.Summary-->**SET TIMEOUT** specifies how much time a serial port command has to complete.<!-- END REF--> If the serial port command does not complete within the specified time, *seconds*, the serial port command is canceled, an error -9990 is generated, and the OK system variable is set to 0\. You can catch the error with an error-handling method installed using [ON ERR CALL](on-err-call.md).

Note that the time is the total time allowed for the command to execute, not the time between characters received. To cancel a previous setting and stop monitoring serial port communication, use a setting of 0 for *seconds*.

The commands that are affected by the timeout setting are:

* [RECEIVE PACKET](receive-packet.md)
* [RECEIVE RECORD](receive-record.md)
* [RECEIVE VARIABLE](receive-variable.md)

#### Example 

The following example sets the serial port to receive data. It then sets a time-out. The data is read with [RECEIVE PACKET](receive-packet.md). If the data is not received in time, an error occurs:

```4d
 SET CHANNEL(MacOS serial port;Speed 9600+Data bits 8+Stop bits one+Parity none) // Open Serial Port
 SET TIMEOUT(10) // Set the timeout for 10 seconds
 ON ERR CALL("CATCH COM ERRORS") // Do not let the method being interrupted
 RECEIVE PACKET(vtBuffer;Char(13)) // Read until a carriage return is met
 If(OK=0)
    ALERT("Error receiving data.")
 Else
    [People]Name:=vtBuffer // Save received data in a field
 End if
 ON ERR CALL("")
```
