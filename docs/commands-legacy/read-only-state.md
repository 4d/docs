| Parameter | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aTable | Table | &#8594;  | Table for which to test read-only state, or Default table, if omitted |

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Read only state.Summary-->This function tests whether or not the state of *aTable* is read-only for the process in which it is called.<!-- END REF--> Read only state returns TRUE if the state of *aTable* is read-only. Read only state returns FALSE if the state of *aTable* is read/ write.

#### Example 

The following example tests the state of an \[Invoice\] table. If the state of the \[Invoice\] table is read-only, it is set to read/write, and then the current record is reloaded.

```4d
 If(Read only state([Invoice]))
    READ WRITE([Invoice])
    LOAD RECORD([Invoice])
 End if
```

**Note:** The invoice record is reloaded to allow the user to modify it. A record that was previously loaded in a read-only state will remain locked until it is reloaded in a read/write state.
