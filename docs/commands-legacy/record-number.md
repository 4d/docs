<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Record number.Summary-->**Record number** returns the physical record number for the current record of *aTable*.<!-- END REF--> If there is no current record, such as when the record pointer is before or after the current selection, **Record number** returns –1\. If the record is a new record that has not been saved, **Record number** returns –3.

Record numbers can change. The record numbers of deleted records are reused.

**4D Server:** This command returns a different result for the On Validate form event depending on whether it is executed on 4D in local mode or 4D in remote mode. In local mode, the command returns a record number (the record is considered as already created). In remote mode, the command returns -3 because, in this case, the record is already created on the server but the information has not yet been sent to the client.

**Note:** It is recommended to use the [Is new record](is-new-record.md) command to check whether a record is in the process of being created. 

#### Example 

The following example saves the current record number and then searches for any other records that have the same data:

```4d
 $RecNum:=Record number([People]) // Get the record number
 QUERY([People];[People]Last =[People]Last) // Anyone else with the last name?
  // Display an alert with the number of people with the same last name
 ALERT("There are "+String(Records in selection([People])+" with that name.")
 GOTO RECORD([People];$RecNum) // Go back to the same record
```
