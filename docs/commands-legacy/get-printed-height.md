#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Get printed height.Summary-->The **Get printed height** command returns the overall height (in pixels) of the section printed using the [Print form](print-form.md) command.<!-- END REF-->

The value returned will be included between 0 (the top edge of the page) and the overall height returned by the [GET PRINTABLE AREA](get-printable-area.md) command (the maximum size of the printable area). 

If you print a new section using the [Print form](print-form.md) command, the height of the new section is added to this value. If the printable area available is insufficient to contain this section, a new page is generated and the value returned is 0.

The right and left printable margins, unlike the top and bottom margins (which may be defined using the [SET PRINTABLE MARGIN](set-printable-margin.md) command), do not influence the value returned.

**Note:** For more information regarding Printing management and terminology in 4D, refer to the [GET PRINTABLE MARGIN](get-printable-margin.md) command description.
