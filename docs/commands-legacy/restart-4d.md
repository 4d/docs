#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.RESTART 4D.Summary-->The **RESTART 4D** command restarts the current 4D application.<!-- END REF--> 

This command is mainly intended for use in the context of a merged application (client/server or single-user) and in conjunction with the [SET UPDATE FOLDER](set-update-folder.md) command. In this case, the automatic update process is launched: the new version of the application designated by [SET UPDATE FOLDER](set-update-folder.md) automatically replaces the current version at the time of the restart resulting from **RESTART 4D**. The pathname of the data file is saved and used automatically. 

If no update information was specified using the [SET UPDATE FOLDER](set-update-folder.md) command in the current session, the command simply restarts the 4D application with the current structure and data files. 

You can use the *time* parameter to defer restarting the application in order to give client machines time to disconnect. You must pass a value in seconds for the *time*. If you omit this parameter, the server application waits, for a maximum of 10 minutes, for all the client applications to be disconnected. After that, all client applications are automatically disconnected. 

**Note:** The *time* and *message* parameters are only taken into account with server applications (they are ignored if the command is executed in a single-user or remote application). 

The optional *message* parameter displays a custom message for connected client applications. 

If the command is executed correctly, the OK system variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0 and the application restarts. You can intercept any errors generated by the command using a method installed using the [ON ERR CALL](on-err-call.md) command.
