id: method=subentityset
title: $method=subentityset 
---


Creates an entity set in Wakanda Server's cache based on the collection of related entities defined in the REST request	

## Description 
  
`$method=subentityset` allows you to sort the data returned by the relation attribute defined in the REST request.

To sort the data, you use the `$subOrderby` property. For each attribute, you specify the order as ASC (or asc) for ascending order and DESC (desc) for descending order. By default, the data is sorted in ascending order.

If you want to specify multiple attributes, you can delimit them with a comma, Âµ, `$subOrderby="lastName desc, firstName asc"`.

### Usage 
 
If you want to retrieve only the related entities for a specific entity, you can make the following REST request where staff is the relation attribute in the Company datastore class linked to the Employee datastore class:

` GET  /rest/Company(1)/staff?$expand=staff&$method=subentityset&$subOrderby=lastName ASC`

#### Response:

```
