## Overview

A style sheet groups together a combination of attributes for form objects â€”  from text attributes to focusable attributes to nearly any available object attribute. 

In addition to harmonizing an application's interface, style sheets provide three major advantages:

*	Saves time during development: Each object has specific group of settings within a single operation.
*	Facilitates maintenance: Style sheets modify the appearance of any objects that uses them, so changing the font size in a style sheet will change the font size for all of the objects that use this same style sheet.
*	Controls multi-platform development: You can have a style sheets that apply to both macOS and Windows platforms, only macOS, or only Windows. When a style sheet is applied, 4D automatically uses the appropriate style sheet. 


4D accepts three, specific style sheet files:

|Style Sheet|Platform|
|---|---|
|styleSheet.css|Default global style sheet for both macOS and Windows|
|styleSheet_mac.css|For defining macOS only specific attribute styles|
|styleSheet_windows.css|For defining Windows only specific attribute styles|

These files are stored in the project's "/SOURCES" folder.



## Style Sheet Selectors

While adapted to meet the specific needs of 4D forms, style sheets for project databases generally follow CSS syntax and grammar. The majority of form object attributes can be defined within a style sheet (not including object types, methods, events, and lists).

Every style rule in a style sheet contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. A selector defines where to apply the style and the declaration defines the actual style to apply. 

Multiple declaration lines can be grouped together to form a declaration block. Each line in a CSS declaration block must end with a semicolon, and the entire block must be surrounded by curly braces. 
 

### Object Type 

Corresponding to the CSS element selector, the object type defines the type of object to style. 

Specify the object, then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply.

In the following example, all objects of the *button* type will display text in the Helvetica Neue font, with a size of 20 pixels: 

```
button {
    font-family: Helvetica Neue;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

To apply the same style to multiple types of objects, specify the objects separated by a "," then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply:

```
text, input {
  text-align: left;
  stroke: grey;
}
```

### Object Name 

Corresponding to the CSS ID selector, the object name defines a specific object to style since the object's name is unique within the form.

Designate the object with a "#" character before the object's name, then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply.

In the following example, the text of the object with the name "okButton" will be displayed in Helvetica Neue font, with a size of 20 pixels: 

```
#okButton {
    font-family: Helvetica Neue;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```



### Class 

Corresponding to the CSS class selector, the class defines the style for all objects with the `.class` attribute. 

Specify the classes to use with a "." character followed by the name of the class, then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply. 

In the following example, the text of all objects with the `okButtons` class will be displayed in Helvetica Neue font, with a size of 20 pixels, aligned in the center:

```
.okButtons {
    font-family: Helvetica Neue;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

To designate that a style should be applied only to objects of a distinct type, specify the type followed by "." and the name of the class, then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply. 

```
text.center {
  text-align: center;
  stroke: red;
}
```

### All Objects 

Corresponding to the CSS universal selector, the "*" character indicates that the following style will be applied to all objects on the form.

Designate that a style should apply to all form objects with the "*" character, then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply.

In the following example, all objects will have a gray fill: 

```
* {
  fill: gray;
}
```


### Specific Attribute 

Corresponding to the CSS attribute selector, styles can be applied to all form objects with a specific attribute. 

Specify the attribute within brackets, then in curly braces, declare the style(s) to apply.

In the following example, all objects with the `borderStyle` attribute will have purple lines:

```
[borderStyle]
{
     stroke: purple;
}
```

To designate that a style should be applied to all objects that have a specific attribute and word, use the `[attribute~="value"]` syntax:

```
[text~=Hello]
{
     stroke: blue;
}

```

To designate that a style should be applied to distinct object types with a specific attribute and value, use the `object type[attribute="value"]` syntax:


```
text[text=Hello]
{
     stroke: blue;
}
```


To designate that a style should be applied to certain object types with a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific value, use the `object type[attribute|="value"]` syntax:

```
text[text|=Hello]
{
     stroke: yellow;
}
```


### Attribute Mapping

The attributes listed below are able to accept either the 4D name or the CSS name.

|4D|CSS|
|---|---|
|borderStyle|border-style|
|fill|background-color|
|fontFamily|font-family|
|fontSize|font-size|
|fontStyle|font-style|
|fontWeight|font-weight|
|stroke|color|
|textAlign|text-align|
|textDecoration|text-decoration|
|verticalAlign|vertical-align|


>CSS attributes can only be used for values supported in CSS





## Priority Order

4D projects prioritizes conflicting style definitions first by the form definition, then by the style sheets.


### JSON vs Style Sheet

If an attribute is defined in the JSON form description and a style sheet, 4D will use the value in the JSON file. 

To override this behavior, the style value must be followed with an `!important` declaration.

**Example 1:**

|JSON form description|Style Sheet|4D displays|
|---|---|---|
|`"text": "Button",`|`text: Edit;`| `"Button"`|


**Example 2:**

|JSON form description|Style Sheet|4D displays|
|---|---|---|
|`"text": "Button",`|`text: Edit !important;`| `"Edit"`|



### Multiple Style Sheets

At run time, 4D automatically prioritizes style sheets in the following order: 

|Style Sheet|Platform|
|---|---|
|styleSheet.css|Default global style sheet. Both macOS and Windows|
|styleSheet_mac.css|macOS only|
|styleSheet_windows.css|Windows only|

1.	The 4D form will first load the default CSS file in "/SOURCES". 
2.	It will then load the CSS file for the current platform in "/SOURCES" .
3.	If it exists, it will then load a specific CSS file defined in the JSON form:

	*	a file for both platforms:
	
	```
	"css": "<path>" 
	```

	*	or a list of files for both platforms:

	```
	"css": [
	     "<path1>",
	     "<path2>" 
	      ],
	```

	*	or a list of files per platform:

	```
	 "css": [
	        {"path": "<path>", "media": "mac"},
	        {"path": "<path>", "media": "windows"},
	    ],
	```

> Filepaths can be relative or absolute.
>*	Relative paths are resolved relative to the JSON form description file.
>*	Absolute path, only filesystems are accepted for security reasons. (*e.g.*, "/RESOURCES", "/DATA")








## Creating a style sheet

You can create style sheets using your preferred text editor and saving the file with a ".css" extension in the project's "/SOURCES" folder. 

The 4D Tool Box provides a **Style Sheets** page as a shortcut option to create and edit one of three platform-specific named style sheets. 

To create a style sheet:

1.	Open the **Style Sheets** page by choosing the **Tool Box > Style Sheet** from the Design menu or click on the **Tool Box** icon in the Form Editor toolbar.

	![](assets/en/FormEditor/stylesheets.png)
	
2.	Select the type of style sheet to create and click on the **Create** button: ![](assets/en/FormEditor/createButton.png)

3.	A dialog will appear allowing you to choose the text editor to use. Select the editor of your preference. It will be set as the default editor and selected automatically for future editing.  

>**Conversion**<br>
>When converting an existing binary database to a project database, 4D saves any existing style sheets in .json files stored in the project's "/SOURCES" folder. They are saved as either macOS or Windows style sheet types. Applied style sheets are added as `class` attributes to form objects' JSON descriptions.
