## Creating a list box

You can create new entity selection list boxes quickly with the **List box builder**. The new list box can be used immediately or it can be edited via the Form editor.

The List box builder lets you create and fill entity selection list boxes in a few simple operations.



## Using the List Box Builder


1.	In the Form editor toolbar, click on the List box builder icon:

	By default, all fields are selected. You can select or deselect fields individually or use **Ctrl+click** (Windows) or **Cmd+click** (macOS) to select or deselect them all at once.
	
	You can change the order of the fields by dragging them and dropping them.

4.	The expression to fill the list box's rows from the entity selection is prefilled:

	This expression can be changed if necessary (e.g., linking entity selection tables)
	
	Clicking on the clipboard icon will copy the expression into memory.
	
5.	Click the the **Build widget** button to create the list box.
