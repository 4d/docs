#### Developer Preview

[**Fluent UI** rendering for 4D forms](../FormEditor/forms.md#fluent-ui-rendering-developer-preview) is proposed in Developer Preview during the beta test program. 


#### Behavior changes

:::caution Index rebuild

4D 21 includes an ICU library update ([see below](#library-table)) which will force an automatic rebuild of indexes of type alpha, text, and object. Depending on the size of the data file, this operation can take a while and may require to be planned.

:::

- Web services (SOAP): when [scalable sessions](../WebServer/sessions.md#enabling-web-sessions) are enabled, web services now run in [**preemptive processes**](../Develop/preemptive.md) in compiled mode. Make sure your SOAP code is thread-safe. 
- Web server: the support of deprecated `4DSYNC/` and `4DCGI/` URLs is removed. No specific processing is done on these URLs anymore. 
- Web user sessions are now returned by [`Process activity`](../commands/process-activity.md).
- The [`HIGHLIGHT TEXT`](../commands/highlight-text) command is now supported in the context of subforms.
- **Components no longer embedded**: starting with 4D 21, components developed by 4D (4D NetKit, 4D SVG..., see [this list](../Extensions/overview.md#components-developed-by-4d)) are no longer embedded in the 4D application. When upgrading a project to 4D 21 or higher, a dialog box is displayed:<br/> 
![alt-text](../assets/en/getStart/convert.png)<br/>
	  - **Import**: import automatically 4D components as dependencies to the project<br/>
	  - **Ignore**: do not import components and let you [manage components manually](../Project/components.md)<br/>
	  - **Ask later**: do not import components and display the dialog at the next project opening.  

:::note

In binary databases, you need to select the required components in the 4D installer or download them from the [4D Product Download portal](https://product-download.4d.com/?type=components).

- Support of [`Try...Catch...End try`](../Concepts/error-handling.md#trycatchend-try) error handling structures.
- QUIC network layer now supports [broadcasting](../Desktop/clientServer.md#opening-a-remote-project), [SSO](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20R5/4D/20-R5/Single-Sign-On-SSO-on-Windows.300-6932709.en.html), and [IPv6](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20R5/4D/20-R5/IP-Settings.300-6932707.en.html).
- Support of [restricted entity selections](../ORDA/entities.md#restricting-entity-selections).
- Support of [shared classes](../Concepts/classes.md#shared-classes) and [singleton classes](../Concepts/classes.md#singleton-classes). New Class properties: [`isShared`](../API/ClassClass.md#isshared), [`isSingleton`](../API/ClassClass.md#issingleton), [`me`](../API/ClassClass.md#me).
- Support for [initializing a class property in its declaration line](../Concepts/classes.md#initializing-the-property-in-the-declaration-line).
- New [force login mode for REST requests](../REST/authUsers.md#force-login-mode) with a [specific support in Qodly Studio for 4D](../WebServer/qodly-studio.md#force-login).
- New [$format](../REST/$format.md) REST parameter.
- [`Session`](../commands/session.md) object is now available in remote user sessions and stored procedures session.
- [**Fixed bug list**](https://bugs.4d.fr/fixedbugslist?version=20_R5): list of all bugs that have been fixed in 4D 20 R5.



#### Behavior changes

- The plug-ins *4D Internet Commands* and *4D for OCI* are no longer included in 4D installers. To get these plug-ins, you need to connect to the [**4D Product Download portal**](https://product-download.4d.com/).
- Changes made in the Structure editor regarding graphical appearance of tables and fields (color, position, order...) are now saved in a separate file named `catalog_editor.json` stored in the project's [`Sources`](../Project/architecture.md#sources) folder.


## 4D 20 R4

Read [**Whatâ€™s new in 4D 20 R4**](https://blog.4d.com/en-whats-new-in-4d-v20-R4/), the blog post that lists all new features and enhancements in 4D 20 R4.



#### Highlights

- Support of [`ECDSA` encryption format](../Admin/tls.md#encryption) for TLS certificates.
- Client/server and SQL server TLS connections are now [configured dynamically](../Admin/tls.md#enabling-tls-with-the-other-servers) (no certificate files are required).
- Direct HTML format for [structure definition exports](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20R4/4D/20-R4/Exporting-and-importing-structure-definitions.300-6654851.en.html).
- New [Code Live Checker](../code-editor/write-class-method.md#warnings-and-errors) that enhances code control during code typing, syntax checking, and compilation steps to prevent execution errors.
- Method parameters declared in `#DECLARE` prototypes are [no longer necessary in "Compiler_" methods](../Concepts/parameters.md).
- Support of [custom date and time formats](../Project/date-time-formats.md)
- New [`Try(expression)` keyword](../Concepts/error-handling.md#tryexpression) to handle simple error cases.
- New [`HTTP Parse message`](../commands/http-parse-message.md) command.
- New [Non-blocking printing](../settings/compatibility.md) compatibility option.
- New [editing mode](../Admin/dataExplorer.md#editing-data) in the Data Explorer.
- [**Fixed bug list**](https://bugs.4d.fr/fixedbugslist?version=20_R4): list of all bugs that have been fixed in 4D 20 R4.



#### Behavior changes

- Using a legacy syntax for declaring parameters (e.g. `C_TEXT($1)` or `var $1 : Text`) is now deprecated and generates warnings at code typing, syntax checking, and compilation steps.
- Selections are now kept consistent after some records have been deleted and others records created (see [this blog post](https://blog.4d.com/4d-keeps-your-selections-of-records-consistent-regarding-deletion-of-records/).
- In the updated [OpenSSL library](#library-table), the default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2. RSA, DSA and DH keys of 1024 bits and above and less than 2048 bits as well as ECC keys of 160 bits and above and less than 224 bits are now no longer allowed. By default, TLS compression was already disabled in previous OpenSSL versions. At security level 2 it cannot be enabled.
- In order to allow password verification when the [4D user directory uses the bcrypt algorithm](https://blog.4d.com/bcrypt-support-for-passwords/), the "password" value in the *connectionInfo* parameter of the [`Open datastore`](../commands/open-datastore.md) command is now sent in clear form by default. Make sure your "On REST authentication" database method can handle passwords in clear form (third parameter is then **False**) and that `Open datastore` encrypts your connection by passing the "tls" option to **True** in *connectionInfo*. In specific cases, a new "passwordAlgorithm" option can also be used for compatibility (see [`Open datastore`](../commands/open-datastore.md) command).



## 4D 20 R3

Read [**Whatâ€™s new in 4D 20 R3**](https://blog.4d.com/en-whats-new-in-4d-20-vR3/), the blog post that lists all new features and enhancements in 4D 20 R3.


#### Highlights

- New [`collection.multiSort`](../API/CollectionClass.md#multisort) function.
- Support of *context* parameter in [`Formula from string`](../commands/formula-from-string.md).
- Support of `headers` property in *connectionHandler* parameter of [4D.WebSocket.new](../API/WebSocketClass.md#4dwebsocketnew).
- [Global modification stamp](../ORDA/global-stamp.md) to help implementing data synchronization modules. New functions: [`ds.getGlobalStamp`](../API/DataStoreClass.md#getglobalstamp) and [`ds.setGlobalStamp`](../API/DataStoreClass.md#setglobalstamp).
- Assigning file references to picture/blob attributes is [supported in ORDA](../ORDA/entities.md#assigning-files-to-picture-or-blob-attributes).
- Support for [initializing the variable's value and data type in the declaration line](../Concepts/variables/#initializing-variables-in-the-declaration-line).
- Log file settings are now [saved with the current data file](../Backup/settings.md#log-management)
- New syntax for [declaring variadic parameters](../Concepts/parameters.md#declaring-variadic-parameters)
- 4D View Pro: Support for the [import](../ViewPro/commands/vp-import-from-blob) and [export](../ViewPro/commands/vp-export-to-blob) of 4D View Pro documents in Blob format.
- [**Fixed bug list**](https://bugs.4d.fr/fixedbugslist?version=20_R3): list of all bugs that have been fixed in 4D 20 R3.



#### Behavior changes

- Some errors were catchable by your [error handling method](../Concepts/error-handling.md) in interpreted mode only. A fix has been done, so that the following errors will now be caught also in compiled mode: *Indice out of range*, *Type incompatible*, and *Dereferencing a Null pointer*. However, for such errors on Intel processors, the procedure is still interrupted as before, whereas on Apple Silicon processors the procedure is only interrupted if you call the [`ABORT`](../commands-legacy/abort.md) command.
- 4D no longer includes an internal PHP interpreter. You need to [set up and run your own PHP interpreter](https://blog.4d.com/deprecation-of-php-commands-and-removal-of-4d-built-in-php-interpreter) to use PHP commands.


## 4D 20 R2

Read [**Whatâ€™s new in 4D 20 R2**](https://blog.4d.com/en-whats-new-in-4d-v20-R2/), the blog post that lists all new features and enhancements in 4D 20 R2.



:::warning Security Note

If your 4D applications use TLS connections, it is recommended that you upgrade to 4D 20 R2 HF1 build 100440 or higher. For more information, refer to this [Security bulletin](https://blog.4d.com/security-bulletin-two-cves-and-how-to-stay-secure/).

#### Highlights

- New [WebSocket class](../API/WebSocketClass.md) to create and manage client WebSocket connections from 4D.
- New QUIC network layer [interface setting](../settings/client-server.md#network-layer).
- 4D View Pro: Support of the **.sjs** file format for the [import](../ViewPro/commands/vp-import-document) and [export](../ViewPro/commands/vp-export-document) of documents.
- 4D Write Pro Interface: New [Table Wizard](../WritePro/writeprointerface.md).
- [**Fixed bug list**](https://bugs.4d.fr/fixedbugslist?version=20_R2): list of all bugs that have been fixed in 4D 20 R2.


#### Behavior changes


- **Warning**: The starting [`offset`](../API/FileHandleClass.md#offset) value of [4D.FileHandle](../API/FileHandleClass.md) objects was incorrectly set to 1 instead of 0. A fix has been made in 4D as of versions **20.1 HF1** and **20 R2** and the value is now 0.
