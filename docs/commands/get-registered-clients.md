| methods | Longint array | <-> | List of the methods to be executed |

<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 



The **GET REGISTERED CLIENTS** command fills two arrays:

* *clientLists* contains the list of clients who were “registered” by using the [REGISTER CLIENT](register-client.md) command.
* *methods* supplies the list of each client’s “workload”. The workload is the number of methods that a 4D Client must still execute by calling the [EXECUTE ON CLIENT](execute-on-client.md) command (for more information, please refer to the description of the [EXECUTE ON CLIENT](execute-on-client.md) command).

#### Example 1 

Let’s assume that you want to obtain a list of all the registered clients and the methods that remain to be executed: 

```4d
 ARRAY TEXT($clients;0)
 ARRAY LONGINT($methods;0)
 GET REGISTERED CLIENTS($clients;$methods)
```

#### Example 2 

Refer to the example of the [REGISTER CLIENT](register-client.md) command.

#### System variables and sets 

If the operation was successful, the OK system variable is equal to 1.
