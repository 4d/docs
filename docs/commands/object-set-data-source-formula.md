| Parameter | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| * | Operator | &#8594;  | If specified, object is an object name (string)<br/>If omitted, object is a field or variable |
| object | any | &#8594;  | Object name (if * is specified) or<br/>Field or variable (if * is omitted) |
| formula | 4D.Formula | &#8594;  | Formula to assign as the data source |

<!-- END REF-->

## Description 

The **OBJECT SET DATA SOURCE FORMULA** command <!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET DATA SOURCE FORMULA.Summary-->  assigns a formula (expression) as the data source of the object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters <!-- END REF-->. The formula must be provided as a [`4D.Formula`](../API/FunctionClass.md#formula-objects) object.

Passing the optional *\** parameter indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, it indicates that the *object* parameter is a field or variable. In this case, you pass a field or variable reference instead of a string (field or variable object only).

The *formula* acts as the source from which the object retrieves its value at runtime. This allows for dynamic behavior, such as calculated values, conditional display, or derived data.

If *Null* is passed as the *formula* parameter, 4D will reset the objectâ€™s data source to an [automatic form variable](../FormObjects/properties_Object.md#dynamic-variables) (`$form_xxxx`).

If the command is applied to an object that does not exist or cannot support formulas, it does nothing.

:::note

 The formula is executed in the context of the form that owns the object. When working with nested forms (e.g., subforms), ensure that the formula is defined and assigned in the appropriate form context to avoid unexpected behavior.

:::


## Example

You want to dynamically bind an input to an expression. For example, show the discounted price based on a base price and a discount value:

```4d

Form.basePrice := 100
Form.discount := 0.2

$discountedFormula := Formula(Form.basePrice * (1 - Form.discount))

OBJECT SET DATA SOURCE FORMULA(*;"DiscountedPriceInput"; $discountedFormula)

```
