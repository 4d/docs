<!-- END REF -->

The `Super` keyword <!-- REF #_command_.Super.Summary -->allows calls to the `superclass`, i.e. the parent class<!-- END REF -->.

`Super` serves two different purposes:

1. Inside a [constructor code]((../Concepts/classes.md#class-constructor), `Super` is a command that allows to call the constructor of the superclass. When used in a constructor, the `Super` command appears alone and must be used before the [`This`](this.md) keyword is used.

- If all class constructors in the inheritance tree are not properly called, error -10748 is generated. It's 4D developer to make sure calls are valid.
- If the `This` command is called on an object whose superclasses have not been constructed, error -10743 is generated.
- If `Super` is called out of an object scope, or on an object whose superclass constructor has already been called, error -10746 is generated.

```4d
// inside myClass constructor
var $text1; $text2 : Text
Super($text1) //calls superclass constructor with a text param
This.param:=$text2 // use second param
```

2. Inside a [class function](#class-function), `Super` designates the prototype of the [`superclass`](../API/ClassClass.md#superclass) and allows to call a function of the superclass hierarchy.

```4d
Super.doSomething(42) //calls "doSomething" function  
//declared in superclasses
```

#### Example 1

This example illustrates the use of `Super` in a class constructor. The command is called to avoid duplicating the constructor parts that are common between `Rectangle` and `Square` classes.

```4d
// Class: Rectangle
Class constructor($width : Integer; $height : Integer)
 This.name:="Rectangle"
 This.height:=$height
 This.width:=$width


Function sayName()
 ALERT("Hi, I am a "+This.name+".")

// Function definition
Function getArea() : Integer

 return (This.height)*(This.width)
```

```4d
//Class: Square

Class extends Rectangle

Class constructor ($side : Integer)

 // It calls the parent class's constructor with lengths
 // provided for the Rectangle's width and height
 Super($side;$side)
 // In derived classes, Super must be called 
 // before you can use 'This'
 This.name:="Square"

Function getArea() : Integer
 return This.height*This.width
```

#### Example 2

This example illustrates the use of `Super` in a class function. You created the `Rectangle` class with a function:

```4d
//Class: Rectangle

Function nbSides() : Text
 return "I have 4 sides"
```

You also created the `Square` class with a function calling the superclass function:

```4d
//Class: Square

Class extends Rectangle

Function description() : Text
  return Super.nbSides()+" which are all equal"
```

Then you can write in a project method:

```4d
var $square : Object
var $message : Text
$square:=cs.Square.new()
$message:=$square.description() //I have 4 sides which are all equal
```
