## Using Form Objects


*	Form editor: Drag a button object from the Form editor onto the form. Then select Button from the Type drop-down list and the style of button (regular, flat, toolbar, bevel, etc.) from the Button Style drop-down list.
*	Code: Define the properties for a button object using JSON. Example:
{"type": "button", "style": "bevel", text": "OK", "action": "Cancel", "left": 60, "top": 160, "width": 100, "height": 20} 
See the Dynamic Forms page for more information.
In addition to adding buttons to your forms, you can also modify their properties (e.g., size, position, label, etc.). The properties available depend on the button's style. See the specific button style you want to use for more information about its available properties.
