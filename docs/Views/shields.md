The Form Editor uses shields to make viewing object properties easier. You can find them on the form toolbar:

![](assets/en/Views/shields.png) 


This function works as follows: Each shield is associated with a property (for example, **Views**, which means the object “is in a view”). When you activate a shield, 4D displays a small icon (shield) in the upper left of each object of the form where the property is applied.

## Using shields

To activate a shield, click the *Shield* icon from the toolbar until the desired shield is selected. You can also click on the right side of the button and select the type of shield to display directly in the associated menu: 


If you don't want to display shields, select **No Shields** in the selection menu. 

>You can set which shields to display by default on the Forms Page of the application Preferences.
