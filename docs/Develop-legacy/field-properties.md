## Class

This property is only available for fields of type **Object**.

It allows you to define a **class-typed object field** in the database structure, enabling code completion, syntax checking, and runtime validation in both the structure editor and the code editor.

When a value is assigned to an entity's object field, 4D ensures that the object belongs to the declared class.
