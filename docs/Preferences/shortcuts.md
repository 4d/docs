This page lists all the shortcuts used in the 4D Design environment (except for standard "system" shortcuts, such as Ctrl+C/Command+C for the Copy command). To modify a shortcut, you can select/deselect the item to modify (Shift, Alt or letter key) in the list. You can also double-click on a shortcut to configure it using a specific dialog box:

Note that each shortcut implicitly includes the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key.

This list is based on the *4DShortcutsvXX.xml* file located in the *4D Extensions* (4D v12) or *Resources* (4D v13) subfolder. If you customize this list in the dialog box, this file is duplicated in the user Preferences folder and is used instead of the standard file. Hence, each time 4D is updated your keyboard shortcut preferences remain.
