#### Description 

The **WP Picture range** command returns a specific range object that addresses only the pictures contained in the *targetObj* you passed as parameter. The image range object returned can be used by [WP GET ATTRIBUTES](wp-get-attributes.md) and [WP SET ATTRIBUTES](wp-set-attributes.md) to handle picture attributes. 

In *targetObj*, you can pass:

* a range, or
* an element (table / row / paragraph / header / footer / body / section / subsection)

#### Example 

You want to change the border color of pictures only:

```4d
 $oPicts:=WP Picture range($oSelection)
 WP SET ATTRIBUTES($oPicts;wk border color;"blue")
```
