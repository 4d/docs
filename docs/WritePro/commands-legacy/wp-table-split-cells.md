#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.WP TABLE SPLIT CELLS.Summary-->The **WP TABLE SPLIT CELLS** command splits the intersecting selection of cells in the *targetObj* or *tableRef* (defined by *startColumn*, *startRow*, *columnCount*, and *rowCount*).<!-- END REF--> A cell will be split only if it has already been merged horizontally, vertically, or both; otherwise, the cell will not be modified.

Pass either:

* *targetObj:*  
   * a range, or  
   * an element (table / row / body / paragraph / anchored image / header / footer / section / subsection), or  
   * a 4D Write Pro document

If *targetObj* does not intersect with a table or text range where a selection of cells can be retrieved, the command doesn't do anything.

If *targetObj* intersects one or many cells that haven’t been merged before, the **WP TABLE SPLIT CELLS** command does nothing.

**OR**

* startColumn and *startRow* \- define the left top coordinates of the first cell to split.
* columnCount and rowCount (optional) - specify respectively the number of columns and the number of rows to be splitted.  
    
If rowCount is omitted, it is the equivalent of passing 1 (default value). If both columnCount and rowCount are omitted, it is the equivalent of splitting a single cell, and if it hasn’t been merged before nothing happens.

If startColumn plus ColumnCount or *startRow* plus rowCount exceeds the number of columns/rows in *tableRef*, or if startColumn or *startRow* is greater than the number of columns/rows in *tableRef*, the returned range contains the maximum possible columns/rows which means every cell in the table (if it has been merged before) is splitted.

#### Example 

You want to designate a range of cells (that contain some already merged cells) and split it:

```4d
 WP TABLE SPLIT CELLS($table;3;2;1;1)
  //or
 $cells:=WP Table get cells($table;3;2;1;1)
 WP TABLE SPLIT CELLS($cells)
```

Result:

Data from the already merged cell is kept all in the first (top left) cell after the split, the other resulting cells from the split remain empty.
