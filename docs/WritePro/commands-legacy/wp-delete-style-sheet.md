#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.WP DELETE STYLE SHEET.Summary-->The **WP DELETE STYLE SHEET** command removes the designated paragraph or character style sheet from the current document.<!-- END REF--> When a style sheet is removed, every character or paragraph that it was applied to reverts to its original style (*i.e.* the default).

This command provides two ways to remove a style sheet. You can specify:

* the style sheet object (created with the [WP New style sheet](wp-new-style-sheet.md) or returned by the [WP Get style sheet](wp-get-style-sheet.md) command) to remove in the *styleSheetType* parameter, or
* the 4D Write Pro document along with the name of the style sheet to remove in the *wpDoc* and *styleSheetName* parameters.

**Note**: The default ("Normal") style sheet can not be deleted.
