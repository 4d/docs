The General page contains options to configure generic parameters for the 4D project.

## Diseño

This area contains the **Display toolbar** option. When it is checked, the 4D toolbar is displayed in the Design environment.

## General

You use this area to set options concerning project startup and operation.

### Modo de inicio

You use this menu to select the default startup mode for the database: **Design** or **Application**. Unless specified, 4D opens by default in the Design environment if a password access system is not activated.


## Componente

This area allows [component developers](../Extensions/develop-components.md) to configure how their component classes and functions will be exposed in the 4D method editor once the component is installed.

### Component namespace in the class store

Use this area to declare a namespace for the component classes and functions in the code on host projects. See [Declaring the component namespace](../Extensions/develop-components.md#declaring-the-component-namespace).

### Generate syntax file for code completion when compiled

When you check this option, a syntax file (JSON format) is automatically created during the compilation phase. See [Code completion for compiled components](../Extensions/develop-components.md#code-completion-for-compiled-components).
