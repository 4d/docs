title: ZIP Folder Archive
---

A 4D ZIP folder archive is a `Folder` object containing one or more folders, which are compressed to be smaller than their original size. These archives are created with a ".zip" extension and can be used to:

*   Save disk space
*   Store data on a removable media device
*   Easily transfer files via mediums which may have size limitations (e.g., email or inter/intranet systems)

4D ZIP archives are created and handled with the following 4D commands:

*   [ZIP Create archive](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18R4/4D/18-R4/ZIP-Create-archive.301-4982187.en.html)
*   [ZIP Read archive](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18R4/4D/18-R4/ZIP-Read-archive.301-4982192.en.html)
