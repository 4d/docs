title: Documenting a project
---

## 概要

In project databases, you can document your methods as well as your forms, tables, or fields. Creating a documentation is particularly appropriate for databases being developed by multiple programmers and is generally good programming practice. Documentation can contain a description of an element as well as any information necessary to understand how the element functions in the database.

The following project elements accept documentation:

- Methods (database methods, component methods, project methods, form methods, 4D Mobile methods, triggers, and classes)
- フォーム
- Tables and Fields

Your documentation files are written in markdown syntax (.md files) using any editor that supports markdown. They are stored as independant files within your project folder.

Documentation is displayed in the right-side pane of the Explorer:

![](assets/en/Project/explorer_Doc.png)

It can also be exposed partially as [code editor tips](#viewing-documentation-in-the-code-editor).

## Documentation files

### Documentation file name

Documentation files get the same name as their attached element, with the ".md" extension. For example, the documentation file attached to the `myMethod.4dm` project method will be named `myMethod.md`.

In the Explorer, 4D will automatically display the documentation file with the same name as the selected element (see below).

### Documentation file architecture

All documentation files are stored in the `Documentation` folder, located at the first level of the package folder.

The `Documentation` folder architecture is the following:

- **Documentation**
    
    + **Classes** 
        * myClass.md
    * **DatabaseMethods** 
        * onStartup.md
        * ...
    * **フォーム** 
        * loginDial.md
        * ...
    * **メソッド** 
        * myMethod.md
        * ...
    * **TableForms** 
        * **1** 
            - input.md
            - ...
        - ...
    - **Triggers** 
        * table1.md
        * ...
* A project form and its project form method share the same documentation file for form and method.

* A table form and its table form method share the same documentation file for form and method. 

> Renaming or deleting a documented element in your project will result in renaming or deleting the associated markdown file.

## Documentation in the Explorer

### Viewing documentation

To view a documentation in the Explorer window:

1. Make sure the right side panel is displayed.
2. Select the documented element in the Explorer list.
3. Click the **Documentation** button located below the preview area.

![](assets/en/Project/comments-explo2.png)

- If no documentation file was found for the selected element, a **Create** button is displayed (see below).

- Otherwise, if a documentation file exists for the selected element, the contents are displayed in the area. The contents are not directly editable in the pane.

### Editing documentation file

You can create and/or edit a markdown documentation file from the Explorer window for the selected element.

If there is no documentation file for the selected element, you can:

- click on the **Create** button in the `Documentation` pane or,
- choose the **Edit Documentation...** option in the contextual menu or options menu of the Explorer.

![](assets/en/Project/comments-explo3.png)

4D automatically creates a .md file with a basic template at appropriate name and location and opens it with your default markdown editor.

If a documentation file already exists for the selected element, you can open it with your markdown editor by choosing the **Edit Documentation...** option in the contextual menu or options menu of the Explorer.

## Viewing documentation in the code editor

The 4D code editor displays a part of the documentation of a method in its help tip.

![](assets/en/Project/codeEditor_Comments.png)

If a file named "<MethodName>.md" exists in "<package>/documentation" folder, the code editor displays, by priority:

- Any text entered in a html `comment` tag (*\<!-- command documentation -->*) at the top of the markdown file.

- Or, if no html `comment` tag is used, the first sentence after a `# Description` tag of the markdown file.  
    In this case, the first line contains the **prototype** of the method, automatically generated by the 4D code parser.

> Otherwise, the code editor displays [the block comment at the top of the method code](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18R2/4D/18-R2/Writing-a-method.300-4824019.en.html#4618226).

## Documentation file definition

4D uses a basic template to create new documentation files. This template suggests specific features that allow you to [display information in the code editor](#viewing-documentation-in-the-code-editor).

However, you can use any [supported markdown tags](#supported-markdown).

New documentation files are created with this default contents:

![](assets/en/Project/comments-explo4.png)

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Line
    </th>
    
    <th>
      説明
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      \<!-- Type here your summary -->
    </td>
    
    <td>
      HTML comment. Used in priority as the method description in the <a href="#viewing-documentation-in-the-code-editor">code editor tips</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      ## Description
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Heading level 2 in markdown. The first sentence after this tag is used as the method description in the code editor tips if HTML comment is not used
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      ## Example
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Heading level 2, you can use this area to propose example code
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      ```4D <br>Type here your example ```
    </td>
    
    <td>
      Used to format 4D code examples (uses highlight.js library)
    </td>

## 例題

In the `WP SwitchToolbar.md` file, you can write:

```4d

1 = smallest size, 5 = largest size. 

## Example

C_PICTURE($logo)
C_LONGINT($size)

//Get the largest logo
$logo:=GetLogo(5)
```
