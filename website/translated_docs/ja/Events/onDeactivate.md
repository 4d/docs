| 12   | フォーム             | The form’s window ceases to be the frontmost window |


## 説明

If the window of a form was the frontmost window, this event is called when the window is sent to the background.

This event applies to the form as a whole and not to a particular object. Consequently, if the `On Deactivate` form event property is selected, only the form will have its form method called.
