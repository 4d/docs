## 概要

Drop-down lists are objects that allow the user to select from a list. You manage the items displayed in the drop-down list using an array, a choice list, or a standard action.

On macOS, drop-down lists are also sometimes called "pop-up menu". Both names refer to the same objects. As the following example shows, the appearance of these objects can differ slightly according to the platform:

## Using an array

An [array](Concepts/arrays.md) is a list of values in memory that is referenced by the name of the array. A drop-down list displays an array as a list of values when you click on it.

Drop-down list objects are initialized by loading a list of values into an array. You can do this in several ways:

* Enter a list of default values in the object properties by selecting "\<Static List>" in the [Data Source](properties_DataSource.md) theme of the Property List. The default values are loaded into an array automatically. You can refer to the array using the name of the variable associated with the object.

* Before the object is displayed, execute code that assigns values to the array elements. たとえば:

```4d
  ARRAY TEXT($aCities;6) 
  $aCities{1}:="Philadelphia" 
  $aCities{2}:="Pittsburg" 
  $aCities{3}:="Grand Blanc" 
  $aCities{4}:="Bad Axe" 
  $aCities{5}:="Frostbite Falls" 
  $aCities{6}:="Green Bay" 
```

In this case, the name of the variable associated with the object in the form must be *$aCities*. This code could be placed in the form method and be executed when the `On Load` form event runs.

* Before the object is displayed, load the values of a list into the array using the [LIST TO ARRAY](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv17R5/4D/17-R5/LIST-TO-ARRAY.301-4127385.en.html) command. たとえば:

```4d
   LIST TO ARRAY("Cities";$aCities)
```

In this case also, the name of the variable associated with the object in the form must be *$aCities*. This code would be run in place of the assignment statements shown above.

If you need to save the user’s choice into a field, you would use an assignment statement that runs after the record is accepted. The code might look like this:

```4d
  Case of
    :(Form event=On Load)
       LIST TO ARRAY("Cities";aCities)
       If(Record number([People])<0) `new record
          aCities:=3 `display a default value
       Else `existing record, display stored value
          aCities:=Find in array(aCities;City)
       End if
    :(Form event=On Clicked) `user modified selection
       City:=aCities{aCities} `field gets new value
    :(Form event=On Validate)
       City:=aCities{aCities}
    :(Form event=On Unload)
       CLEAR VARIABLE(aCities)
 End case
```

You must select each [event] that you test for in your Case statement. Arrays always contain a finite number of items. The list of items is dynamic and can be changed by a method. Items in an array can be modified, sorted, and added to.

## Using a choice list

If you want to use a drop-down list to manage the values of a listed field or variable, 4D lets you reference the field or variable directly as the object's data source. This makes it easier to manage listed fields/variables.

> If you use a hierarchical list, only the first level is displayed and can be selected.

For example, in the case of a "Color" field that can only contain the values "White", "Blue", "Green" or "Red", it is now possible to create a list containing these values and associate it with a pop-up menu object that references the 4D "Color" field. 4D then automatically takes care of managing the input and display of the current value in the form.

To associate a pop-up menu/drop-down list or a combo box with a field or variable, you can just enter the name of the field or variable directly in the [Variable or Expression](properties_Object.md#variable-or-expression) of the object in the Property List.

When the form is executed, 4D automatically manages the pop-up menu or combo box during input or display: when a user chooses a value, it is saved in the field; this field value is shown in the pop-up menu when the form is displayed:

> It is not possible to combine this principle with using an array to initialize the object. If you enter a field name in the Variable Name area, then you must use a choice list.

### Save as

When you have associated a pop-up menu/drop-down list with a choice list and with a field, you can use the [Save as Value/Reference property](properties_DataSource.md#save-as). This option lets you optimize the size of the data saved.

## Using a standard action

You can assign a standard action to a pop-up menu/drop-down list ([Action](properties_Action.md#standard-action) theme of the Property List). Only actions that display a sublist of items (except the goto page action) are supported by this object. For example, if you select the `backgroundColor` standard action, at runtime the object will display an automatic list of background colors. You can can override this automatic list by assigning in addition a choice list in which each item has been assigned a custom standard action.

For more information, please refer to the [Standard actions](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv17R5/4D/17-R5/Standard-actions.300-4163633.en.html) section.
