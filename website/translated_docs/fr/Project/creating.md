## Créer un projet

New 4D application projects can be created from **4D** or **4D Server** (see [Developing a project](Project/developing.md)). In any case, project files are stored on the local machine.

To create a new project:

1. Launch 4D or 4D Server.
2. Select **New > Project...** from the **File** menu: <p>![](assets/en/getStart/projectCreate1.png)<p>OU<p>(4D only) Select **Project...** from the **New** toolbar button:<p>![](assets/en/getStart/projectCreate2.png)<p>A standard **Save** dialog appears so you can choose the name and location of the 4D project's main folder.

3. Saisissez le nom du dossier de projet et cliquez sur **Sauvegarder**.<p> Ce nom sera utilisé :
    - as the name of the entire project folder,
    - comme nom du fichier .4DProject au premier niveau du dossier "Project".

    Vous pouvez choisir n'importe quel nom autorisé par votre système d'exploitation. However, if your project is intended to work on other systems or to be saved via a source control tool, you must take their specific naming recommendations into account.

When you validate the **Save** dialog, 4D closes the current project (if any), creates a project folder at the indicated location, and puts all files needed for the project into it. Pour plus d'informations, voir [Architecture d'un projet 4D](Project/architecture.md).

You can then start developing your project.


## Ouvrir un projet local

Pour ouvrir un projet existant en local depuis 4D :

1. Select **Open a local application project** in the Welcome Wizard dialog, <p>OU<p> Select **Open/Local Project...** from the **File** menu or the **Open** toolbar button.<p> The standard Open dialog appears.

2. Select the project's `.4dproject` file and click **Open**.<p> By default, the project is opened with its current data file. Other file types are suggested:

    - *Packed project files*: `.4dz` extension  - deployment projects
    - *Shortcut files*: `.4dlink` extension - store additional parameters needed for opening projects or applications (addresses, identifiers, etc.)
    - *Binary files*: `.4db` or `.4dc` extension - legacy 4D database formats

### Options

In addition to standard system options, the *Open* dialog in 4D provides two menus with specific options that are available using the **Open** button and the **Data file** menu.

- **Open** - opening mode of the project:
    - **Interpreted** or **Compiled**: These options are available when the selected project contains both [interpreted and compiled code](Concepts/interpreted.md).
    - **[Maintenance Security Center](MSC/overview.md)**: Opening in secure mode allowing access to damaged projects in order to perform any necessary repairs.

- **Data file** - specifies the data file to be used with the project. By default, the **Current data file** option is selected.


## Opening a remote project

The first time you connect to a 4D Server project via a remote 4D, you will usually use the standard connection dialog. Thereafter, you will be able to connect directly using the **Open Recent Projects** menu or a 4DLink shortcut file ([see below](#project-opening-shortcuts)).

To connect remotely to a 4D Server project:

1. Select **Connect to 4D Server** in the Welcome Wizard dialog, <p>OU<p> Select **Open/Remote Project...** from the **File** menu or the **Open** toolbar button.

The 4D Server connection dialog appears. This dialog has three tabs: **Recent**, **Available**, and **Custom**.

If 4D Server is connected to the same network as the remote 4D, select **Available**. 4D Server includes a built-in TCP/IP broadcasting system that, by default, publishes the name of the 4D Server projects available over the network. The list is sorted by order of appearance and updated dynamically.

To connect to a server from the list, double-click on its name or select it and click the **OK** button.

> A circumflex accent (^) is placed before the name of projects published with the encryption option enabled.

If the published project is not displayed in the **Available** list, select **Custom**. The Custom page allows you to connect to a published server on the network using its network address and assigning it a customized name.

- **Project name**: Defines the local name of the 4D Server project. This name will be used in the **Recent** page when referring to the project.
- **Network address**: The IP address of the machine where the 4D Server was launched. <p>If two servers are executed simultaneously on the same machine, the IP address must be followed by a colon and port number, for example: `192.168.92.104:19814`. <p>By default, the publishing port of a 4D Server is 19813. This number can be modified in the Project settings.

Once this page assigns a server, clicking the **OK** button will allow you to connect to the server.

> If the project is published with the encryption option enabled, you must add a circumflex accent (^) before the name, otherwise the connection will be refused. For more information, refer to the Encrypting Client/Server Connections section.

Once a connection to the server has been established, the remote project will be listed on the **Recent** tab.



## Project opening shortcuts

4D offers two ways to let you open projects directly and bypass the Open dialog:

- via menu options:
    -   *Menu bar* - **File** > **Open Recent Projects / {project name}**
    -   *4D Tool bar* -  Select the project from the menu associated with the **Open** button

- via preferences:
    -   Set the **At startup** general preference to **Open last used project**.
