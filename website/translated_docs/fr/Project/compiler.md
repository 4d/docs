title: Compilation
---

You can compile your project, i.e., translate all of your methods into machine language. Compiling a project lets you check the consistency of the code and accelerate its execution, as well as making it possible to obfuscate the code in its entirety. Compilation is an indispensable step between the development of projects using 4D and their deployment as stand-alone applications.

The compilation process is entirely automatic; however, compilation requires greater rigor when writing 4D code. The compiler will indicate any programming errors and situate them in their context.


## About Compilers

4D contains two compilers:

- a "classic" compiler, used to compile native code for Intel/AMD processors;
- a Silicon compiler, used to compile native code for Apple Silicon processors.

The classic compiler can be used on any platform, while the Silicon compiler can only be used on a Mac machine:

![](assets/en/Project/compileModes.png)

Both compilers are integrated into 4D. The appropriate compiler is automatically selected depending on the [compilation target](#compilation-target) option.



### Classic Compiler

The classic compiler generates native compiled code for Intel/AMD processors on any machines. It does not require any specific configuration.

Resulting compiled code is stored in the [DerivedData](architecture.md#deriveddata-folder) folder of the project.


### Silicon Compiler

The Silicon compiler generates native compiled code for Apple Silicon processors, such as *Apple M1*. This compiler has specific requirements and features.

#### Pré-requis

- **Apple machine**: The Silicon compiler can only be run from an Apple machine.
- **4D Project architecture**: The Silicon compiler is only available for 4D developments using [project architecture](architecture.md).
- **Xcode or Developer Tools**: The Silicon compiler calls the **Clang** open-source macOS compiler to compile the project from C++ code at the [second step](#two-step-incremental-compiler) of compilation. *clang* requires Apple native libraries, which are provided by either the **Xcode** or **Developer Tools** package.
    - **If you already have** Xcode or Developer Tools installed on your computer, you only need to make sure that its version is compliant with 4D requirements.
    - **If you do not have** any of these tools installed on your computer, you will need to download one of them from the Apple Developer web site.

> We recommend to install **Xcode**, which is more simple to install. However, it is a large library with a lot of unnecessary components. You can decide to install **Developer Tools** which is more compact, however its installation is a little more complex.

In any cases, the 4D Silicon compiler will warn you if your configuration does not comply with its requirements.


#### Two-step compiler

The Silicon compiler is a two-step compiler:

1. At a first step, it translates the 4D code into C++ source files.
2. Then, it compiles the C++ result into Silicon code using **clang**.

The resulting code is stored in the [Libraries folder](architecture.md#libraries-folder), within the project folder.

The files generated during the compilation are stored per project and per user in the [user preferences folder](architecture.md#userpreferencesusername-folder). Two sets of files are generated:

- `.cpp` (text) files, containing C++ code,
- `.o` files are binary objects, generated by clang.


#### Incremental compiler

The Silicon compiler is incremental, which means that during the [first compilation step](#two-step-compiler), only **new or modified methods** are translated into C++, thus reducing drastically the compilation time.

> In the initial compilation, **all** 4D methods are translated into C++; on large applications, it could take a certain time. However this step only occurs once.


## Compiler Window

Whatever the [selected compiler](#about-compilers), project compilation is carried out using the [compiler window](#compiler-window). To display the compiler window, select the **Compiler...** command in the **Design** menu. You can also use the **Compiler** toolbar button:

![](assets/en/Project/compilerWin1.png)

> It is also possible to launch compilation directly using the **Start Compilation** menu item from the **Design** menu. In this case, the compiler automatically uses the current [compilation settings](#compiler-settings).

This window is used for launching the compilation of the project or checking the syntax of the methods and classes. In addition, buttons can be used for generating/regenerating Typing methods, clearing the compiled code, displaying/hiding warnings, and accessing the [compiler settings window](#compiler-settings).

![](assets/en/Project/comp1.png)


> Compilation requires an appropriate license. Without this license, it is not possible to carry out a compilation (buttons are disabled). Nevertheless, it is still possible to check the syntax and generate Typing methods.

### Compiler

The **Compiler** button causes the immediate launching of the compilation process. It is the exact equivalent of the **Start Compilation** command in the **Design** menu. If the project has already been compiled, the new code compiled will replace the former. Initially, different passes are carried out for checking, typing and initialization, in accordance with the configuration set on the [compiler settings window](#compiler-settings).

If no errors are detected, the actual compilation begins. If errors are detected, the process is stopped and the information area of the window displays the method names and line numbers concerned in a hierarchical list:

![](assets/en/Project/compilerWin2.png)


Double-click on each error detected in order to open the method or class concerned directly in the 4D method editor; the line containing the error is highlighted and the type of error is displayed in the syntax area of the window. The **Previous Error** / **Next Error** commands of the **Method** menu allow you to navigate among the lines containing errors.

> The number of errors found during your first compilations may be daunting, but do not let this put you off. You will soon discover that they often spring from the same source, i.e., non-compliance with certain project conventions. The compiler always provides a precise diagnosis of the errors in order to help you correct them.

### Check Syntax

The **Check Syntax** button starts the execution of the syntax-checking phase. At the end of checking, any errors detected are listed in the information area. You can double–click on an error line in order to display the corresponding method.

Syntax checking can also be launched directly using the **Check Syntax** command associated with the **Compiler** toolbar button. This option is the only one available if you do not have a suitable license to allow the compilation of applications.

### Generate Typing

The **Generate Typing** button creates or updates typing compiler methods. Compiler methods are project methods that group together all the variable and array typing declarations (process and interprocess), as well as the method parameters. These methods, when they exist, are used directly by the compiler during code compilation, which accelerates compilation. If these methods already exist, their contents are updated.

The name of these methods must mandatorily begin with `Compiler_`. You can set the default name for each of the 5 compiler methods in the [compiler settings window](#compiler-methods-for). The compiler methods that are generated and maintained by 4D automatically have the `Invisible` attribute:

![](assets/en/Project/compilerWin3.png)

Only the necessary compiler methods (i.e., those for which items already exist in the project) are generated.

The information area indicates any errors found during method creation or updating. Double-clicking on an error line causes the method and line concerned to be displayed in the Method editor.


### Clear compiled code

The **Clear compiled code** button deletes the compiled code of the project. When you click on it, all of the code generated during compilation is deleted.

The **Restart Compiled** command of the **Run** menu is then disabled and the "Compiled Project" option is not available at startup.


### Show warnings

Warnings are specific messages generated by the compiler when it checks the syntax. These messages are intended to draw your attention to statements that might lead to execution errors. They do not prevent compilation.

Depending on circumstances and the programming style used, these warnings may be more or less relevant. You have an option for displaying or hiding the warnings in the information area of the compiler window.

![](assets/en/Project/compilerWin4.png)

When this option is checked, the warnings (if any) are displayed in the window, after the other error types. They appear in italics:

![](assets/en/Project/compilerWin5.png)

Double-clicking a warning opens the corresponding method.

#### Disabling warnings during compilation

You can selectively disable certain warnings during compilation by inserting the following into the code of a 4D method:

```4d
  //%W-<warning number>
```

Only warnings with numbers can be disabled. Warning numbers are specified at the end of each message in the list of compilation errors. For example, to disable the following warning:

*1: Pointer in an array declaration (518.5)*

... you just need to write the following comment in a 4D method, preferably a `COMPILER_xxx` method (method compiled first):

```4d
  //%W-518.5
```



## Compiler Settings

The "Compiler" page of the Settings lets you set parameters relating to project compilation. You can directly open this page from the [compiler window](#compiler-window) by clicking on the Compiler Preferences button:

![](assets/en/Project/compilerWin6.png)


### Compilation options

This area groups the generic options used during the compilation process.

#### Generate the symbol file

Used to generate the [symbol file](#symbol-file), a text file containing the list of variables along with their type and the method from which their type has been inferred. The symbol file also contains the list of your methods and functions along with the type of their parameters and the type of result, if any. The [symbol file](#symbol-file) is placed in the project folder and is named `ProjectName_symbols.txt`.


#### Generate error file

Used to generate the [error file](#error-file) at the time of syntax checking. It lists general errors as well as errors linked to a specific line, and warnings. Any errors detected by the compiler are automatically accessible in the **Method** menu of 4D. However, having an error file that can be transmitted from one machine to another can be useful. The [error file](#error-file) is automatically named `ProjectName_errors.xml` and is created in the project folder.


#### Compilation Path

Used to set the number of passes performed by the compiler and thus the duration of compilation.

- **Type the variables**: Passes by all the stages that make compilation possible.
- **Process and interprocess are typed**: The pass for typing process and interprocess variables is not carried out. This option can be used when you have already carried out the typing of all your process and interprocess variables either yourself or using the function for the automatic generation of compiler methods.
- **All variables are typed**: The pass for typing local, process and interprocess variables is not carried out. Use this option when you are certain that all the process, interprocess and local variables have been clearly typed.

#### Compilation Target

<details><summary>Historique</summary>
| Version | Modifications |
| ------- | ------------- |
| v19     | Ajoutées      |
</details>

This setting allows you to select the processor family for which your 4D project must be natively compiled. The 4D compiler can build native code for two processor families:

- **Intel/AMD** processors (all machines),
- **Apple Silicon** processors.

Two target options are proposed. The result depends on the processor of the machine on which 4D is running.

| *Option*                                         | *on Windows Intel/AMD*                                                                    | *on macOS Intel/AMD*                                                                        | *on macOS Silicon*                                                                          |

> Apple Silicon compiler target requires that the **Clang** application be installed on your machine. Clang comes with the latest version of Xcode. See the [Silicon compiler requirements](#requirements) for more information.

### Default typing

You use this area to set the default type for ambiguous database objects.

- **Numeric**: Used to force numeric typing in an unambiguous manner, either in real or longint. It has no priority over any directives that may have been placed in your project. You can optimize the running of your database by choosing the Longint type.
- **Button**: Used to force button typing in an unambiguous manner, either in real or longint. It has no priority over any directives that may have been placed in your project. It concerns buttons as well as check boxes, picture buttons, button grids, radio buttons, picture pop-up menus and drop-down lists.

### Compiler Methods for...

This area lets you rename the Compiler methods that are generated automatically by the compiler when you click [Generate Typing](#generate-typing).

Up to 5 compiler methods may be generated; a compiler method is only generated if the project contains the corresponding items:

- **Variables**: Groups together process variable declarations;
- **Interprocess Variables**: Groups together interprocess variable declarations;
- **Arrays**: Groups together process array declarations;
- **Interprocess Arrays**: Groups together interprocess array declarations;
- **Methods**: Groups together method parameter declarations (for instance, `C_LONGINT(mymethod;$1;$2)`).

You can rename each of these methods in the corresponding areas. Nevertheless, they will always be preceded by the label `Compiler_` (non-modifiable). The name of each method (prefix included) must be no longer than 31 characters. It must also be unique and compliant with [4D rules for naming methods](Concepts/identifiers.md#project-methods).


## Compilation log files

### Symbol file

The symbol file is generated if you checked the [**Generate the symbol file**](#generate-the-symbol-file) option in the compiler settings. The file is placed in the project folder and is named `ProjectName_symbols.txt`. It is divided into several parts:

#### List of process and interprocess variables

These two lists contains four columns:

- Names of process and interprocess variables and arrays used in your project. These variables are listed in alphabetical order.
- Type of the variable. Types are set by compiler directive commands or are determined by the compiler based on the use of the variable. If the type of a variable cannot be determined, the column is empty.
- Number of dimensions if the variable is an array.
- Reference to the context in which the compiler established the type of the variable. If the variable is used in several contexts, the context mentioned is the one used by the compiler to determine its type.
    - If the variable was found in a database method, the database method name is given, preceded by (M)*.
    - If the variable was found in a project method, the method is identified as it has been defined in 4D, preceded by (M).
    - If the variable was found in a trigger, the table name is given, preceded by (TM).
    - If the variable was found in a form method, the form name is given, preceded by the table name and (FM).
    - If the variable was found in an object method, the object method’s name is given, preceded by the form name, table name, and by (OM).
    - If the variable is an object in a form and does not appear in any project, form or object methods, nor any triggers, the name of the form in which it appears is given, preceded by (F). At the end of each list, you can find the sizes of the process and interprocess variables in bytes.

> When compiling, the compiler cannot determine in which process a given process variable is used. A process variable can have a different value in each process. Consequently, all process variables are systematically duplicated as each new process is launched: it is thus advisable to watch out for the amount of memory that they will take up. Also, keep in mind that the space for process variables is not related to the stack size for the process.

#### List of local variables

The list of local variables is sorted by database method, project method, trigger, form method, and object method, in the same order as in 4D.

This list is divided into three columns:

- list of local variables used in the method;
- type of the variable;
- number of dimensions if the variable is an array.

#### Complete list of methods

A complete list of your database and project methods is given at the end of the file with:

- their type (procedure or function returning a value)
- the data types of their parameters and the returned result
- the number of calls
- the Thread Safe or Thread Unsafe property.

This information appears as follows:

```
Procedure or Function <Method name>(parameter data types):
result data type, number of calls, Thread Safe or Thread Unsafe
```

### Error file

You can choose whether or not to generate an error file during compilation using the [**Generate error file**](#generate-error-file) option in the compiler settings. The error file is automatically named `projectName_errors.xml` and is placed in the project folder.

Although the errors can be accessed directly via the compiler window, it can be useful to have an error file that can be transmitted from one machine to another, particularly in the case of several different developers working together in a client-server environment. The error file is generated in XML format in order to facilitate automatic parsing of its contents. It also allows the creation of customized error display interfaces.

The length of the error file depends on the number of errors and warnings issued by the compiler.

The structure of the error file is as follows:

- At the top of the file is the list of errors and warnings, sorted by method and in the order of their creation in 4D. In the ***General errors*** section, all the typing impossibilities and identity ambiguities are grouped together. These errors and warnings are listed using the following format:
    - the line number in the method (0 indicates general errors);
    - the warning attribute indicates whether the detected anomaly is a warning (warning="true") or an error (warning="false");
    - a diagnostic that describes the error. If your project does not have any general errors, the file will not have a *General errors* section.

An error file may contain three types of messages:

- **Errors linked to a specific line**: these errors are displayed in context — the line in which they were found — with an explanation. The compiler reports this type of error when it encounters an expression in which it sees an inconsistency related to data type or syntax. In the compiler window, double–click on each error detected in order to open the method concerned directly in the 4D Method editor with the line containing the error highlighted.

- **General errors**: These are errors that make it impossible to compile the project. There are two cases in which the compiler reports a general error:
    - The data type of a process variable could not be determined.
    - Two different kinds of objects have the same name. General errors are so named because they cannot be linked to any specific method. In the first case, the compiler could not perform a specified typing anywhere in the project. In the second, it was unable to decide whether to associate a given name with one object rather than with another.

- **Warnings**: Warnings are not errors. Warnings do not prevent the project from being compiled; they simply point out potential code errors. In the compiler window, warnings appear in italics. Double-click on each warning to open the method concerned directly in the 4D Method editor with the line concerned by the warning highlighted.


## Execution in compiled mode

### Run Compiled

Once the project is compiled, it is still possible to switch from [interpreted mode to compiled mode](Concepts/interpreted.md), and vice versa, at any time using the **Restart Interpreted** and **Restart Compiled** commands of the **Run** menu, without having to quit the 4D application — except when the interpreted code has been removed. The [Open project dialog box](creating.md#options) also allows the choice of interpreted or compiled mode on startup of the database.

When you switch from one mode to the other, 4D closes the current mode and opens the new one. This amounts to exiting then reopening the application. Consequently, each time you change from one mode to another, 4D executes the two following database methods (if specified) in this order: `On Exit` -> `On Startup`.

If you modify your project in interpreted mode, you must recompile it in order to have your edits taken into account in compiled mode.

### Range checking

Whereas [compiler log files](#compilation-log-files) operate during the compilation process, range checking begins when you run the compiled project. That is, range checking messages only appear when your compiled project is running.

Range checking provides additional analysis with respect to the quest for logical and syntactical consistency which normally characterizes a compiler. During range checking, the compiler poses the following question: "Considering what you have requested, will the result that I am likely to obtain surprise you?". Range checking is an *in situ* controller; it evaluates the status of objects in the projects at a given time.

Here is how range checking works. Suppose that you declared the array `MyArray` as Text. The number of elements in `MyArray` may vary depending on the current method. If you want to assign the value “Hello” to element 5 of `MyArray` , you would write:

```4d
MyArray{5}:="Hello"
```

If `MyArray` has five or more elements at that time, everything is fine. Assignment proceeds normally. However, if `MyArray` has less than five elements at that time, your assignment no longer makes sense.

A situation like this cannot be detected at the time of compilation since it presupposes the execution of the methods. The compiler would not know the circumstance in which this method is called. Only range checking enables you to monitor what is actually happening while your project is in use. In the above example, the compiler would display an execution error from within 4D. It is easy to see why range checking is especially valuable when arrays, pointers, and strings of characters are being processed.

#### Disabling range checking locally

There may be some cases where you prefer that range checking not be applied to certain parts of code that are considered to be reliable. More particularly, in the case of loops that are repeated a great number of times, and when running the compiled database on older machines, range checking can significantly slow down processing. Insofar as you have the certitude that the code concerned is reliable and cannot cause system errors, you can disable range checking locally.

To do this, you must surround the code to be excluded from range checking with the special comments `//%R-` and `//%R+`. The `//%R-` comment disables range checking and `//%R+` enables it again:

```4d
  // %R-   to disable range checking

 ... //Place the code to be excluded from range checking here

  // %R+   to enable range checking again for the rest
```
