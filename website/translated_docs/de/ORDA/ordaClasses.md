title: ORDA Data Model Classes
---

## Preview feature

> ORDA data model class functions are provided as a **preview feature** in 4D v18 R4: all functions you create are exposed without restrictions. Future releases will include more control over the function availability, especially from REST requests. In the next release, **by default all your data model class functions will be set to private**. You will have to specify individually each function that you want to be exposed.

## Overview

ORDA allows you to create high-level class functions above the data model. This allows you to write business-oriented code and "publish" it just like an API. Datastore, dataclasses, entity selections, and entities are all available as class objects that can contain functions.

For example, you could create a `getNextWithHigherSalary()` function in the `EmployeeEntity` class to return employees with a salary higher than the selected one. It would be as simple to call as:

```4d
$nextHigh:=ds.Employee(1).getNextWithHigherSalary()
```

Developers can not only use these functions in local datastores, but also in client/server as well as remote architectures (see the full example [below](#example-with-remote-datastore)):

```4d
 //$cityManager is the reference of a remote datastore
Form.comp.city:=$cityManager.City.getCityName(Form.comp.zipcode)
```

Thanks to this feature, the entire business logic of your 4D application can be stored as a independent layer so that it can be easily maintained or reused:

- it allows you to "hide" the overall complexity of the underlying physical structure and only expose understandable and ready-to-use functions.

- if the physical structure evolves, you simply to adapt function code and client applications will continue to call them transparently.

In addition, 4D Developer [automatically pre-creates](#creating-classes) the classes for each available data model object.

## Architecture

ORDA provides **generic classes** exposed through the **`4D`** [class store](Concepts/classes.md#class-stores), as well as **user classes** (extending generic classes) exposed in the **`cs`** [class store](Concepts/classes.md#class-stores):

![](assets/en/ORDA/ClassDiagramImage.png)

All ORDA data model classes are exposed as properties of the **`cs`** class store. The following ORDA classes are available:

| Class                       | Example name         | Instantiated by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cs.DataStore                | cs.DataStore         | `ds` command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

> ORDA user classes are stored as regular class files (.4dm) in the Classes subfolder of the project [(see below)](#class-files).

In addition, object instances from ORDA data model user classes benefit from their parent's properties and functions. For example, an Entity class object can call functions from the [ORDA Entity generic class](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18R3/4D/18-R3/ORDA-Entity.201-4900374.en.html).

## Class Description

> **Note**: Keep in mind that ORDA data model functions are always executed on the server. Thus, calling a function generates a request to the server.

### DataStore Class

A 4D database exposes its own DataStore class in the `cs` class store.

- **Extends**: 4D.DataStoreImplementation 
- **Class name**: cs.DataStore

You can create functions in the DataStore class that will be available through the `ds` object.

#### Beispiel

```4d
// cs.DataStore class

Class extends DataStoreImplementation

Function getDesc
  $0:="Database exposing employees and their companies"
```

This function can then be called:

```4d
$desc:=ds.getDesc() //"Database exposing..."
```

### DataClass Class

Each table exposed with ORDA offers a DataClass class in the `cs` class store.

- **Extends**: 4D.DataClass 
- **Class name**: cs.*DataClassName* (where *DataClassName* is the table name)
- **Example name**: cs.Employee

#### Beispiel

```4D
// cs.Company class


Class extends DataClass

// Returns companies which revenue is over the average
// Returns an entity selection related to the DataClass Company 

Function GetBestOnes()
    $sel:=This.query("revenues >= :1";This.all().average("revenues"));
    $0:=$sel
```

Then, you can get an entity selection of the "best" companies by executing:

```4d
    var $best : cs.CompanySelection
    $best:=ds.Company.GetBestOnes()
```

#### Example with a remote datastore

The following *City* catalog is exposed in a remote datastore (partial view):

![](assets/en/ORDA/Orda_example.png)

The `City Class` provides an API:

```4d
// cs.City class

Class extends DataClass

Function getCityName()
    var $1, $zipcode : Integer
    var $zip : 4D.Entity
    var $0 : Text

    $zipcode:=$1
    $zip:=ds.ZipCode.get($zipcode)
    $0:="" 

    If ($zip#Null)
        $0:=$zip.city.name
    End if
```

The client application opens a session on the remote datastore:

```4d
$cityManager:=Open datastore(New object("hostname";"127.0.0.1:8111");"CityManager")
```

Then a client application can use the API to get the city matching a zip code (for example) from a form:

```4d
Form.comp.city:=$cityManager.City.getCityName(Form.comp.zipcode)

```

### EntitySelection Class

Each table exposed with ORDA offers an EntitySelection class in the `cs` class store.

- **Extends**: 4D.EntitySelection 
- **Class name**: *DataClassName*Selection (where *DataClassName* is the table name)
- **Example name**: cs.EmployeeSelection

#### Beispiel

```4d
// cs.EmployeeSelection class


Class extends EntitySelection

//Extract from this entity selection the employees with a salary greater than the average

Function withSalaryGreaterThanAverage
    C_OBJECT($0)
    $0:=This.query("salary > :1";This.average("salary")).orderBy("salary")

```

Then, you can get employees with a salary greater than the average in any entity selection by executing:

```4d
$moreThanAvg:=ds.Company.all().employees.withSalaryGreaterThanAverage()
```

### Entity Class

Each table exposed with ORDA offers an Entity class in the `cs` class store.

- **Extends**: 4D.Entity 
- **Class name**: *DataClassName*Entity (where *DataClassName* is the table name)
- **Example name**: cs.CityEntity

#### Beispiel

```4d
// cs.CityEntity class


Class extends Entity

Function getPopulation()
    $0:=This.zips.sum("population")


Function isBigCity
C_BOOLEAN($0)
// The function getPopulation() is usable inside the class
$0:=This.getPopulation()>50000
```

Then, you can call this code:

```4d
var $cityManager, $city : Object

$cityManager:=Open datastore(New object("hostname";"127.0.0.1:8111");"CityManager")
$city:=$cityManager.City.getCity("Caguas")

If ($city.isBigCity())
    ALERT($city.name + " is a big city")
End if
```

## Definition Rules

When creating or editing data model classes, you must pay attention to the rules described below.

- Since they are used to define automatic DataClass class names in the **cs** [class store](Concepts/classes.md#class-stores), 4D table names must be compliant in order to avoid any conflict in the **cs** namespace. Das bedeutet im einzelnen:
    
    - Do not give the same name to a 4D table and to a [user class name](Concepts/classes.md#class-names). If such a case occurs, the constructor of the user class becomes unusable (a warning is returned by the compiler). 
    - Do not use a reserved name for a 4D table (e.g. "DataClass").
- When defining a class, make sure the [`Class extends`](Concepts/classes.md#class-extends-classnameclass) statement matches exactly the parent class (case sensitive) name. For example, `Class extends EntitySelection` for an entity selection class.

- You cannot instantiate a data model class object with the `new()` keyword (an error is returned). You must use a regular [instantiation method](#architecture).

- You cannot override a native ORDA class method from the **`4D`** [class store](Concepts/classes.md#class-stores) with a data model user class function.

## Support in 4D projects

### Datei Klasse

An ORDA data model user class is defined by adding, at the [same location as regular class files](Concepts/classes.md#class-files) (*i.e.* in the `/Sources/Classes` folder of the project folder), a .4dm file with the name of the class. For example, an entity class for the `Utilities` dataclass will be defined through a `UtilitiesEntity.4dm` file.

### Creating classes

4D automatically pre-creates empty classes in memory for each available data model object.

![](assets/en/ORDA/ORDA_Classes-3.png)

> By default, empty ORDA classes are not displayed in the Explorer. You need to show them by selecting **Show all data classes** from the Explorer's options menu: ![](assets/en/ORDA/showClass.png)

ORDA user classes have a different icon from regular classes. Empty classes are dimmed:

![](assets/en/ORDA/classORDA2.png)

To create an ORDA class file, you just need to double-click on the corresponding predefined class in the Explorer. 4D creates the class file and add the `extends` code. For example, for an Entity class:

    Class extends Entity
    

Once a class is defined, its name is no longer dimmed in the Explorer.

### Editing classes

To open a defined ORDA class in the 4D method editor, select or double-click on an ORDA class name and use **Edit...** from the contextual menu/options menu of the Explorer window (like for any class):

![](assets/en/ORDA/classORDA4.png)

For ORDA classes based upon the local datastore (ds), you can directly access the class code from the 4D Structure window:

![](assets/en/ORDA/classORDA5.png)

### Method editor

In the 4D method editor, variables typed as an ORDA class automatically benefit from autocompletion features. Example with an Entity class variable:
