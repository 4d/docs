## Pathname

Pathname of a static source picture for a [picture button](pictureButton_overview.md), [picture pop-up Menu](picturePopupMenu_overview.md), or [static picture](staticPicture.md). You must use the POSIX syntax.

Two main locations can be used for static picture path:

- in the **Resources** folder of the project database. Appropriate when you want to share static pictures between several forms in the database. In this case, the Pathname is "/RESOURCES/\<picture path\>".
- in an image folder (e.g. named **Images**) within the form folder. Appropriate when the static pictures are used only in the form and/or you want to be able to move or duplicate the whole form within the project or different projects. In this case, the Pathname is "\<picture path\>" and is resolved from the root of the form folder.

## Display

### Scaled to fit

`JSON grammar: "scaled"`

The **Scaled to fit** format causes 4D to resize the picture to fit the dimensions of the area.

### Replicated

`JSON grammar: "tiled"`

When the area that contains a picture with the **Replicated** format is enlarged, the picture is not deformed but is replicated as many times as necessary in order to fill the area entirely.

If the field is reduced to a size smaller than that of the original picture, the picture is truncated (non-centered).

### Center / Truncated (non-centered)

`JSON grammar: "truncatedCenter" / "truncatedTopLeft"`

The **Center** format causes 4D to center the picture in the area and crop any portion that does not fit within the area. 4D crops equally from each edge and from the top and bottom.

The **Truncated (non-centered)** format causes 4D to place the upper-left corner of the picture in the upper-left corner of the area and crop any portion that does not fit within the area. 4D crops from the right and bottom.

> When the picture format is **Truncated (non-centered)**, it is possible to add scroll bars to the input area.
