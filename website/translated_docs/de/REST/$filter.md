id: filter
title: '$filter'
---


 
Allows to query the data in a dataclass or method *(e.g.*, `$filter="firstName!='' AND salary>30000"`)

## Description

This parameter allows you to define the filter for your dataclass or method.

### Using a simple filter

A filter is composed of the following elements:

**{attribute} {comparator} {value}**

For example: `$filter="firstName=john"` where `firstName` is the **attribute**, `=` is the **comparator** and `john` is the **value**.

### Using a complex filter

A more compex filter is composed of the following elements, which joins two queries:

**{attribute} {comparator} {value} {AND/OR/EXCEPT} {attribute} {comparator} {value}**

For example: `$filter="firstName=john AND salary>20000"` where `firstName` and `salary` are attributes in the Employee datastore class.

### Using the params property

You can also use 4D's params property.

**{attribute} {comparator} {placeholder} {AND/OR/EXCEPT} {attribute} {comparator} {placeholder}&$params='["{value1}","{value2}"]"'**

For example: `$filter="firstName=:1 AND salary>:2"&$params='["john",20000]'"` where firstName and salary are attributes in the Employee datastore class.

For more information regarding how to query data in 4D, refer to the [dataClass.query()](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18/4D/18/dataClassquery.305-4505887.en.html) documentation.

> When inserting quotes (') or double quotes ("), you must escape them using using their character code:
> 
> - Quotes ('): \u0027 
>     - Double quotes ("): \u0022</p> 
>         For example, you can write the following when passing a value with a quote when using the *params* property:  
>         `http://127.0.0.1:8081/rest/Person/?$filter="lastName=:1"&$params='["O\u0027Reilly"]'`
>         
>         If you pass the value directly, you can write the following: `http://127.0.0.1:8081/rest/Person/?$filter="lastName=O'Reilly"`</blockquote> 
>         
>         ## Attribute
>         
>         If the attribute is in the same dataclass, you can just pass it directly (*e.g.*, `firstName`). However, if you want to query another dataclass, you must include the relation attribute name plus the attribute name, i.e. the path (*e.g.*, employer.name). The attribute name is case-sensitive (`firstName` is not equal to `FirstName`).
>         
>         You can also query attributes of type Object by using dot-notation. For example, if you have an attribute whose name is "objAttribute" with the following structure:
>         
>             {
>                 prop1: "this is my first property",
>                 prop2: 9181,
>                 prop3: ["abc","def","ghi"]
>             }
>             
>         
>         You can search in the object by writing the following:
>         
>         `GET  /rest/Person/?filter="objAttribute.prop2 == 9181"`
>         
>         ## Comparator
>         
>         The comparator must be one of the following values:
>         
>         | Comparator | Description              |
>         | ---------- | ------------------------ |
>         | =          | equals to                |
>         | !=         | not equal to             |
>         | >          | greater than             |
>         | >=         | greater than or equal to |
>         | <          | less than                |
>         | <=         | less than or equal to    |
>         | begin      | begins with              |

>         In the following example, we look for all employees whose last name begins with a "j":
>         
>              GET  /rest/Employee?$filter="lastName begin j"
>             
>         
>         In this example, we search the Employee datastore class for all employees whose salary is greater than 20,000 and who do not work for a company named Acme:
>         
>              GET  /rest/Employee?$filter="salary>20000 AND  
>              employer.name!=acme"&$orderby="lastName,firstName"
>             
>         
>         In this example, we search the Person datastore class for all the people whose number property in the anotherobj attribute of type Object is greater than 50:
>         
>              GET  /rest/Person/?filter="anotherobj.mynum > 50"
