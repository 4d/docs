Returns the query as it was executed by 4D Server (*e.g.*, `$querypath=true`)

## Description

`$querypath` returns the query as it was executed by 4D Server. If, for example, a part of the query passed returns no entities, the rest of the query is not executed. The query requested is optimized as you can see in this `$querypath`.

For more information about query paths, refer to [queryPlan and queryPath](genInfo.md#querypath-and-queryplan).

In the steps collection, there is an object with the following properties defining the query executed:

| Property      | Typ        | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| description   | String     | Actual query executed or "AND" when there are multiple steps                |
| time          | Zahl       | Number of milliseconds needed to execute the query                          |
| recordsfounds | Zahl       | Number of records found                                                     |
| steps         | Collection | An collection with an object defining the subsequent step of the query path |


## Beispiel

If you passed the following query:

`GET  /rest/Employee/$filter="employer.name=acme AND lastName=Jones"&$querypath=true`

And no entities were found, the following query path would be returned, if you write the following:

`GET  /rest/$querypath`

**Response**:

    __queryPath: {
    
        steps: [
            {
                description: "AND",
                time: 0,
                recordsfounds: 0,
                steps: [
                    {
                        description: "Join on Table : Company : People.employer = Company.ID",
                        time: 0,
                        recordsfounds: 0,
                        steps: [
                            {
                                steps: [
                                    {
                                        description: "Company.name = acme",
                                        time: 0,
                                        recordsfounds: 0
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    
    }
    

If, on the other hand, the first query returns more than one entity, the second one will be executed. If we execute the following query:

`GET  /rest/Employee/$filter="employer.name=a* AND lastName!=smith"&$querypath=true`

If at least one entity was found, the following query path would be returned, if you write the following:

`GET  /rest/$querypath`
