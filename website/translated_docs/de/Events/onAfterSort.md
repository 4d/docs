## Description

This event is generated just after a standard sort is performed (*i.e.* it is NOT generated if $0 returns -1 in the [`On Header Click`](onHeaderClick.md) event). This mechanism is useful for storing the directions of the last sort performed by the user. In this event, the `Self` command returns a pointer to the variable of the sorted column header.
