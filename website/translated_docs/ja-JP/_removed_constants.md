A constant is an expression that has a fixed value. There are two types of constants:

- literal constants for which you type the actual value. These constants are described with each type in the [data-types](data-types.md) page.
- predefined constants that you select by name.

## Predefined Constants

4D provides a set of predefined constants. These constants are grouped by themes in the Explorer Window:

To use a predefined constant in a **Method editor** window, you can:

- Drag and drop the constant from the Explorer window to the Method editor window, or
- Directly type its name in the Method editor window. The autocomplete mechanism suggests constants that correspond to the programming context.

Predefined constants appeared underlined by default within the Method Editor and Debugger windows:

In the window shown here, `On Load`, for example, is a predefined constant.
