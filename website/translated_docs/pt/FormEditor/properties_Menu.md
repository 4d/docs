## Associated Menu Bar

When a menu bar is associated to a form, it is added to the right of the current menu bar when the form is displayed in Application environment.

The selection of a menu command causes an `On Menu Selected` event to be sent to the form method; you can then use the `Menu selected` command to test the selected menu.

> If the menu bar of the form is identical to the current menu bar, it is not added.

The form menu bar will operate for both input and output forms.
