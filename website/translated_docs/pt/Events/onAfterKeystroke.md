## Descrição

> The `On After Keystroke` event can generally be replaced by the [`On After Edit`](onAfterEdit.md) event (see below).

After the [`On Before Keystroke`](onBeforeKeystroke.md) and `On After Keystroke` event properties are selected for an object, you can detect and handle the keystrokes within the object, using the `FORM event` command that will return `On Before Keystroke` and then `On After Keystroke` (for more information, please refer to the description of the `Get edited text` command).

> These events are also activated by language commands that simulate a user action like `POST KEY`.

The `On After Keystroke` event is not generated:

- in [list box columns](FormObjects/listbox_overview.md#list-box-columns) method except when a cell is being edited (however it is generated in any cases in the [list box](FormObjects/listbox_overview.md) method),
- when user modifications are not carried out using the keyboard (paste, drag-and-drop, checkbox, drop down list, combo box). To process these events, you must use [`On After Edit`](onAfterEdit.md).


### Keystroke sequence

When an entry requires a sequence of keystrokes, the [`On Before Keystroke`](onBeforeKeystroke.md) and [`On After Keystroke event`] events are generated only when the entry is fully validaded by the user. The `Keystroke` command returns the validated character. This case mainly occurs:

- when using "dead" keys such as ^ or ~: events are generated only when the extended character is eventuelly entered (e.g. "ê" or ñ),
- when an IME (Input Code Editor) displays an intermediary dialog box where the user can enter a combination of characters: events are generated only when the IME dialog is validated.
