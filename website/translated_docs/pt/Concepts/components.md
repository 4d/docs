A 4D component is a set of 4D methods and forms representing one or more functionalities that you can install and use in your projects. For example, the [4D SVG component](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv19R3/4D/19-R3/4D-SVG-Component.100-5681501.en.html) adds advanced commands and an integrated rendering engine that can be used to display SVG files.

## Where to find components?

Several components are [preinstalled in the 4D development environment](Extensions/overview.md), but a lot of 4D components from the 4D community [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=4d-component&type=Repositories). Additionnally, you can [develop your own 4D components](Extensions/develop-components.md).


## Installing components

To install a component, you simply need to copy the component files into the [`Components` folder of the project](Project/architecture.md). You can use aliases or shortcuts.

A host project running in interpreted mode can use either interpreted or compiled components. A host project running in compiled mode cannot use interpreted components. In this case, only compiled components can be used.

## Using components

Component methods and forms can be used as standard elements in your 4D development.

When an installed component contains methods, they appear in the **Component Methods** theme of the Explorer's Methods page.

You can select a component method and click on the **Documentation** button of the Explorer to get information about it, [if any](Project/documentation.md).
