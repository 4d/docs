  "description": "If more than one person uses a database, which is usually the case in client-server architecture or Web interfaces, you need to control access or provide different features according to the connected users. It is also essential to provide security for sensitive data. You can provide this security by assigning passwords to users and creating access groups that have different levels of access to information in the database or to database operations.",
