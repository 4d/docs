title: Data Collection
---

To help us make our products always better, we automatically collect data regarding usage statistics on running 4D Server applications. Collected data is completely anonymous and data is transferred with no impact on the user experience. 

This page explains:

- what information is collected,
- where information is stored and when it is sent to 4D,
- how to disable automatic data collection in client/server built applications.


## Collected information

Data is collected during the following events: 

- database startup,
- database closure,
- web server startup,
- php execution,
- client connection,
- data collection sending.

Some data is also collected at regular intervals.

### Collected at database startup

### Collected every time PHP execute is called

|Data|Type|Notes|
|---|----|---|

|connectionSystems|Collection|Client OS without the build number (in parenthesis) and number of clients using it|



## Where is it stored and sent?

Collected data is written in a text file (JSON format) per database when 4D Server quits. The file is stored inside the [active 4D folder](https://doc.4d.com/4dv20/help/command/en/page485.html), i.e.:

- on Windows: `Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\4D Server`
- on macOS: `/Users/[userName]/Library/ApplicationSupport/4D Server`

Once a week, the file is automatically sent over the network to 4D. The file is then deleted from the active 4D folder.

> If the file could not be sent for some reason, it is nevertheless deleted and no error message is displayed on the 4D Server side. 

The file is sent to the following server address: `https://dcollector.4d.com` (ip: 195.68.52.83).


## Disabling data collection in client/server built applications

You can disable the automatic data collection in [client/server built applications](../Desktop/building.md#clientserver-page).

To disable the collection, pass the value **False** to the [`ServerDataCollection`](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20/4D/20/ServerDataCollection.300-6335775.en.html) key in the `buildApp.4DSettings` file, used to build the client/server application.
