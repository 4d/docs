title: Using preemptive web processes
---


The 4D Web Server allows you to take full advantage of multi-core computers by using preemptive web processes in your applications. You can configure your web-related code, including 4D tags, web database methods or ORDA REST class functions to run simultaneously on as many cores as possible.

For in-depth information on preemptive process in 4D, please refer to the [Preemptive Processes](../Develop/preemptive.md) section.

## Availability of preemptive mode for web processes  

The following table indicates whether the preemptive mode is used or is available, depending on the execution context:

|4D Server|Interpreted ([debugger attached](../Debugging/debugging-remote.md))|Interpreted (debugger detached)|Compiled|
|---|---|---|---|
|REST Server|cooperative|preemptive|preemptive|
|Web Server|cooperative|cooperative|*web setting*|
|Web Services Server|cooperative|cooperative|*web setting*|

|4D remote/single-user|Interpreted|Compiled|
|---|---|---|
|REST Server|cooperative|preemptive|
|Web Server|cooperative|*web setting*|
|Web Services Server|cooperative|*web setting*|

- REST Server: handles [ORDA data model class functions](../REST/ClassFunctions.md)
- Web Server: handles [web templates](templates.md), [4DACTION and database methods](httpRequests.md)
- Web Service Server: handles SOAP requests
- ***web setting*** means that the preemptive mode depends on the [**scalable sessions**](sessions.md#enabling-web-sessions) status:
	- if scalable sessions are enabled, the preemptive mode is automatically used for web and web service processes.
	- if scalable sessions are not enabled:
		- for web processes, the [**Use preemptive processes**](webServerConfig.md#use-preemptive-processes) option is taken into account.
		- for web service processes (server or client), preemptive mode is supported at method level. 




## Writing thread-safe web server code  

All 4D code executed by the web server must be thread-safe if you want your web processes to be run in preemptive mode. When the [preemptive mode is enabled](#availability-of-preemptive-mode-for-web-processes), the following parts of the application will be automatically evaluated by the 4D compiler:

*	All web-related database methods:
	*	[`On Web Authentication`](authentication.md#on-web-authentication)
	*	[`On Web Connection`](httpRequests.md#on-web-connection)
	*	`On REST Authentication`
	*	[`On Mobile App Authentication`](https://developer.4d.com/go-mobile/docs/4d/on-mobile-app-authentication) and [`On Mobile App Action`](https://developer.4d.com/go-mobile/docs/4d/on-mobile-app-action)

*	The `compiler_web` project method (regardless of its actual "Execution mode" property);

*	Basically any code processed by the [`PROCESS 4D TAGS`](../commands-legacy/process-4d-tags.md) command in the web context, for example through .shtml pages

*	Any project method with the "Available through 4D tags and URLS (`4DACTION`, etc.)" attribute

*	Triggers for tables with "Expose as REST resource" attribute

*	[ORDA data model class functions](../REST/ClassFunctions.md) called via REST

For each of these methods and code parts, the compiler will check if the [thread-safety rules are respected](../Develop/preemptive.md#writing-a-thread-safe-method), and will return errors in case of issues. 

## Thread-safety of 4D web code  

Most of the web-related 4D commands and functions, database methods and URLs are thread-safe and can be used in preemptive mode.

### 4D commands and database methods  

All 4D web-related commands are thread-safe, *i.e.*:

*	all commands from the *Web Server* theme,
*	all commands from the *HTTP Client* theme.

The web-related database methods are thread-safe and can be used in preemptive mode (see above): `On Web Authentication`, `On Web Connection`, `On REST Authentication`...).

Of course, the code executed by these methods must also be thread-safe.


### Web Server URLs  

The following 4D Web Server URLs are thread-safe and can be used in preemptive mode:

*	*4daction/* (the called project method must also be thread-safe)
*	*4dwebtest/*
*	*4dblank/*
*	*4dstats/*
*	*4dhtmlstats/*
*	*4dcacheclear/*
*	*rest/*
*	*4dimgfield/* (generated by `PROCESS 4D TAGS` for web request on picture fields)
*	*4dimg/* (generated by `PROCESS 4D TAGS` for web request on picture variables)

### Preemptive web process icon  

Both the Runtime Explorer and the 4D Server administration window display a specific icon for preemptive web processes:
