#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.WP Import document.Summary-->The **WP Import document** command converts an existing 4D Write Pro / 4D Write document (.4wp, .4w7 or .4wt) or MS Word document (.docx) to a new 4D Write Pro object.<!-- END REF-->

In the *filePath* parameter, pass the path of a document stored on disk. The following types of documents are supported:

* former 4D Write documents (.4w7 or .4wt). For a detailed list of 4D Write features that are currently supported in 4D Write Pro objects, please refer to the *Importing 4D Write documents* section.
* 4D Write Pro (.4wp) format documents. For more information about the 4D Write Pro document format, refer to *.4wp document format*.
* documents in .docx format. For more information about, refer to *Importing and Exporting in .docx format*.

You must pass a complete path, unless the document is located at the same level as the structure file, in which case you can just pass its name.

**Note:** If you want to import a document stored in a 4D BLOB field, you can also consider using the [WP New](wp-new.md) command.

An error is returned if the *filePath* parameter is invalid, or if the file is missing or the file format is not supported.

The optional *option* parameter allows defining import options for:

* **longint**  
    
By defaut, HTML expressions inserted in legacy 4D Write documents are not imported (no 4D Write Pro support). If you pass the wk import html expressions as text constant, HTML expressions will be imported as raw text within *##htmlBegin##* and *##htmlEnd##* tags -- which will require formatting actions afterwards. For example:  
    
```RAW  
##htmlBegin##Imported titlebold##htmlEnd##  
```
* **object**  
    
You can pass an object to define how the following attributes are handled during the import operation:  
    
    
| **Attribute**           | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**Compatibility Notes**

* *Character style sheets in legacy 4D Write documents use a proprietary mechanism, which is not supported by 4D Write Pro. To get the best result for imported text, style sheet attributes are converted to "hard coded" style attributes. Legacy character style sheets are not imported and are no longer referenced in the document.*
* *Support for importing in .docx format is only certified for Microsoft Word 2010 and newer. Older versions, particularly Microsoft Word 2007, may not import correctly.*

#### Example 1 

```4d
 var WPDoc : Object
 WPDoc:=WP Import document("C:\\documents\\4DWriteDocs\\Letter.4w7")
```

#### Example 2 

You want to import a .docx document and would like that paragraph borders are collapsed as they are in MS Word:

```4d
 $options:=New object
 $options.borderRules:="collapse" //collapse paragraph borders while converting
 
 wpDoc:=WP Import document(«mydoc.docx»;$options)
```

You want to import original .docx fields as text (for fields not converted to 4D formulas):

```4d
 $options:=New object
 $options.fields:="label" //for unconverted fields, import field references as text between {{ and }}
 
 wpDoc:=WP Import document(«mydoc.docx»;$options)
```

You want to import a .docx document whose text is mostly in Japanese:

```4d
 $options:=New object
 $options.preferredFontScriptType:="eastAsia" //force conversion to prefer eastAsia font scripts
 
 wpDoc:=WP Import document(«mydoc.docx»;$options)
```
