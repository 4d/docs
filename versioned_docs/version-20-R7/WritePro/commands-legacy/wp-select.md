#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.WP SELECT.Summary-->The **WP SELECT** command creates a new selection in the 4D Write Pro *wpArea* area, based upon the *targetObj* or a new range defined by *startRange* and *endRange*.<!-- END REF-->

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, you indicate that *wpArea* is a form object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, you indicate that *wpArea* is a 4D Write Pro object variable or field. If no 4D Write Pro area is passed in the *wpArea* parameter, the command does nothing.

**Note**: This command can only be used if the *wpArea* is associated with a form object (*i.e.* it is displayed in the current form/page).

To define the selection, you can either pass an existing object in *targetObj*, or pass a pair of *startRange* / *endRange* boundaries.

The following syntaxes are supported:

* *WP SELECT({\* ;} wpArea ; targetObj)*  
where *targetObj* can be:  
   * a range, or  
   * an element (table / row / paragraph / anchored or inline picture / text box / body / header / footer / section / sub-section), or  
   * a 4D Write Pro document (only body element used).
* *WP SELECT({\* ;} wpArea ; startRange ; endRange)*
* *WP SELECT( targetObj {; startRange ; endRange} )*  
where *targetObj* can be:  
   * a range, or  
   * an element (table / row / paragraph / anchored or inline picture / body / header / footer / section / sub-section), or  
   * a 4D Write Pro document.  
where *startRange* and *endRange* are allowed only for the following elements: body / header / footer / section / sub-section.

In *startRange* and *endRange*, pass values corresponding to the position of the first and last characters to select in the area. You can pass wk start text in *startRange* to define the beginning of the area, and wk end text in *endRange* to define the end of the area. Keep in mind that a 4D Write Pro document not only contains visible text but also formatting tags that are included in the range.

#### Example 

The following code:

```4d
 $range:=WP Text range([SAMPLE]WP;wk start text;12)
 WP SELECT(*;"WParea";$range)
```

... will have the same result as:

```4d
 WP SELECT(*;"WParea";wk start text;12)
```
