#### Compatibility 

<!--REF #_command_.WP Selection range.Summary-->**WP Selection range** was named **WP Get selection** in previous versions of 4D Write Pro.<!-- END REF--> It has been renamed for clarity. 

#### Description 

The **WP Selection range** command returns a new range object or a picture object based upon the currently selected content in the *wpArea* 4D Write Pro area.

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, you indicate that *wpArea* is a form object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, you indicate that *wpArea* is a 4D Write Pro object variable or field. If no 4D Write Pro area is passed in the *wpArea* parameter, an empty object is returned.

**Note**: This command can only be used if the *wpArea* is associated with a form object (*i.e.* it is displayed in the current form/page).

If an anchored image (picture at a fixed location) is selected in *wpArea*, **WP Selection range** returns a picture reference object and not a range object (for more information, please refer to the [WP Add picture](wp-add-picture.md) command description). Otherwise, **WP Selection range** returns a new range object. For more information on range objects, please refer to *Range handling commands*.

#### Example 

You want to get the selected text from a 4D Write Pro area:

```4d
Â $range:=WP Selection range(*;"WParea")
```
