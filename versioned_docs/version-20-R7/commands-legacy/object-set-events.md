#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET EVENTS.Summary-->The **OBJECT SET EVENTS** command modifies, for the current process, the configuration of the form events of the form or object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters.<!-- END REF-->

Passing the optional *\** parameter indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, it indicates that the *object* parameter is a field or variable. In this case, you pass a field or variable reference instead of a string (field or variable object only).  
To define the configuration of events for the form itself, pass the optional *\** parameter and an empty string "" in *object*: in this case, you designate the current form. 

**Note:** If you want to modify the events of a subform related to a table, you can only use the syntax based on the object name. 

In the *arrEvents* parameter, pass a Longint array containing the list of predefined or custom form events that you want to modify (you can use the *mode* parameter to specify whether the modification consists of enabling or disabling the events). To designate a predefined event to modify, you can pass, in each element of the *arrEvents* array, one of the following constants, found in the "*Form Events*" theme:

It is important to note that the On Load event is not included in this list: this event cannot be defined because it has already been generated during the execution of the command.

In *arrEvents*, you can also pass any value corresponding to a custom event. In this case, we recommend using negative values (see the [CALL SUBFORM CONTAINER](call-subform-container.md) command). 

You use the *mode* parameter to set the overall processing to be carried out for the array elements. To do this, you can pass one of the following constants, found in the "*Form Objects (Properties)*" theme:

| Constant                        | Type    | Value | Comment                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disable events others unchanged | Longint | 2     | All the events listed in the *arrEvents* array are disabled; the status of other events remain unchanged |
| Enable events disable others    | Longint | 0     | All the events listed in the *arrEvents* array are enabled; all the other events are disabled            |
| Enable events others unchanged  | Longint | 1     | All the events listed in the *arrEvents* array are enabled; the status of other events remain unchanged  |

The **OBJECT SET EVENTS** command can lead to the enabling of events that are not supported by the *object* (depending on its type). In this case, the events will simply be ignored.

If an *object* is duplicated after a call to the **OBJECT SET EVENTS** command, the resulting enabled/disabled configuration is also duplicated.

#### Example 1 

Enabling three form events for a set of list box objects and disabling other events:

```4d
 ARRAY LONGINT($MyEventsOnLB;3)
 $MyEventsOnLB {1}:=On After Sort
 $MyEventsOnLB {2}:=On Column Moved
 $MyEventsOnLB {3}:=On Column Resize
 OBJECT SET EVENTS(*;"MyLB@";$MyEventsOnLB;Enable events disable others)
  // enables 3 events and disables all others
```

#### Example 2 

Disabling three form events for a set of list box objects, without modifying the other events:

```4d
 ARRAY LONGINT($MyEventsOnLB;3)
 $MyEventsOnLB {1}:=On After Sort
 $MyEventsOnLB {2}:=On Column Moved
 $MyEventsOnLB {3}:=On Column Resize
 OBJECT SET EVENTS(*;"MyLB@";$MyEventsOnLB;Disable events others unchanged)
  // disables only these 3 events
```

#### Example 3 

Enabling a form event for an object, without modifying the other events:

```4d
 ARRAY LONGINT($MyEventsOnLB;1)
 $MyEventsOnLB {1}:=On Column Moved
 OBJECT SET EVENTS(*;"Col1";$MyEventsOnLB;Enable events others unchanged)
  // only enables this event
```

#### Example 4 

Disabling all events of the form:  

```4d
 ARRAY LONGINT($MyFormEvents;0)
 OBJECT SET EVENTS(*;"";$MyFormEvents;Enable events disable others)
  // disables all events
```

#### Example 5 

Disables a single event of the form without modifying the others:

```4d
 ARRAY LONGINT($MyFormEvents;1)
 $MyFormEvents{1}:=On Timer
 OBJECT SET EVENTS(*;"";$MyFormEvents;Disable events others unchanged)
  // only disables this event
```
