#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.MODIFY SELECTION.Summary-->**MODIFY SELECTION** does almost the same thing as [DISPLAY SELECTION](display-selection.md).<!-- END REF--> Refer to the description of [DISPLAY SELECTION](display-selection.md) for details. The differences between the two commands are:

1\. [DISPLAY SELECTION](display-selection.md) and **MODIFY SELECTION** enable you to display the current selected records in list mode, or in the input form when you double-click on a record. Using **MODIFY SELECTION**, you can also modify the fields of the record in the input form when you double-click on it, if it is not already in use by another process or user, or in “Enter in List” mode (if it is authorized).

2\. [DISPLAY SELECTION](display-selection.md) loads the records in Read-only mode in the current process, which means that they are not locked for writing in the other processes. **MODIFY SELECTION** places all the records of the selection in Read-Write mode, which means that they are automatically locked for writing in other processes. **MODIFY SELECTION** frees the records when its execution is completed.
