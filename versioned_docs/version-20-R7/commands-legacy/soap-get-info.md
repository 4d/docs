#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SOAP Get info.Summary-->The **SOAP Get info** command retrieves, in the form of a character string, the different types of information concerning a SOAP request.<!-- END REF--> 

When you process a SOAP request, it can be useful to obtain additional information — other than the RPC parameter values — about the request. For instance, for security reasons, you can use this command in the *On Web Authentication Database Method* to find out the name of the requested Web Service method. 

Pass the number of the type of SOAP information you want to get in the *infoNum* parameter. You can use the following predefined constants, located in the *Web Services (Server)* theme:

| Constant          | Type    | Value | Comment                                             |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SOAP method name  | Longint | 1     | Name of the Web Service method about to be executed |
| SOAP service name | Longint | 2     | Name of the Web Service to which the method belongs |

**Note:** Also for security reasons, it is possible to set the maximum size for Web Services requests sent to 4D. This configuration is carried out using the [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md) command.
