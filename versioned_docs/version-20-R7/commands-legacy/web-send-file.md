#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.WEB SEND FILE.Summary-->The **WEB SEND FILE** command sends, to the Web browser, the HTML page or the Web file stored in the document whose pathname you pass in *htmlFile*.<!-- END REF--> 

By default, 4D looks for the HTML document within the root folder, defined in the Database Settings. 

This command accepts as a parameter either pathnames in Posix syntax (names of directories or folders are separated with a slash "/") or in the system syntax.  
Specifying an invalid pathname generates an error related to file management for your operating system. You can intercept this error using a method installed by the [ON ERR CALL](on-err-call.md) command. If the method displays a warning or message dialog box, it will appear on the browser machine.

Once **WEB SEND FILE** is executed, the OK system variable is updated: if the file to be sent exists and if the timeout has not run out, OK is equal to 1\. Otherwise, it is equal to 0.

**Note:** If you call **WEB SEND FILE** from within a process that is not a Web process, the command does nothing and returns no error; the call is simply ignored.

The references to 4D variables and *4DSCRIPT* type tags found on the page are parsed when the document type allows for it (document based on text).

#### Example 

The HTML root folder of the database is the WebDocs folder. It contains the following elements:

```4d
 ..\WebDocs\HTM\MyPage.HTM
```

Sending the Web page *"MyPage.HTM"* must be carried out in the following manner :

```4d
 WEB SEND FILE("HTM/MyPage.HTM")
```

#### System variables and sets 

If the file to be sent exists and if the timeout has not run out, OK is set to 1\. Otherwise, it is equal to 0.
