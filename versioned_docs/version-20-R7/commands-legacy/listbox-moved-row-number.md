#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.LISTBOX MOVED ROW NUMBER.Summary-->The **LISTBOX MOVED ROW NUMBER** command returns two numbers in *oldPosition* and *newPosition* indicating respectively the previous position and the new position of the row moved in the list box, specified by the *object* and *\** parameters.<!-- END REF-->

**Note:** You can only move rows in array type list boxes.

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, you indicate that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, you indicate that the *object* parameter is a variable. In this case, you pass a variable reference instead of a string. For more information about object names, refer to the *Object Properties* section. 

This command must be used with the form event On Row Moved (see the [Form event code](form-event-code.md) command). 

**Note:** This command does not take into account any hidden/displayed states of list box rows.
