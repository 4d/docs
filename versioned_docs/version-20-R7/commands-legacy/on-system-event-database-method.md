#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.On System Event database method.Summary-->The **On System Event database method** is called each time a system event occurs.<!-- END REF--> This concerns all 4D environments: 4D (all modes) and 4D Server, as well as 4D applications that are compiled and merged with 4D Volume Desktop.

To process an event, you must test the value of the $1 parameter within the method and compare it to one of the following constants, found in the *Database Events* theme:

| Constant                       | Type    | Value | Comment                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| On application background move | Longint | 1     | The 4D application moves to the background |
| On application foreground move | Longint | 2     | The 4D application moves to the foreground |

These events are generated when a 4D application changes level, irrespective of the user action initiating this change. For example: 

* Clicking the window of the application or of another application,
* selecting it using the **Alt+Tab** (Windows) or **Command+Tab** (Mac OS) keyboard shortcut,
* Selecting the **Hide** command in the dock (Mac OS),
* Clicking the application icon in the dock or task bar,
* Clicking the minimize button of the main window (Windows).

It is absolutely necessary to declare the $1 parameter (longint) in the database method. The structure of the database method code is therefore:

```4d
  // On System Event database method
 
 var $1 : Integer
 Case of
    :($1=On application background move)
  //Do something
    :($1=On application foreground move)
  //Do something else
 End case
```
