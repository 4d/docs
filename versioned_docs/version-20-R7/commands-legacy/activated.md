*This command is not thread-safe, it cannot be used in preemptive code.*


#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Activated.Summary-->The **Activated** command (obsolete) returns **True** in a form method when the window containing the form becomes the frontmost window of the frontmost process.<!-- END REF--> 

**Note:** This command is equivalent to using [Form event code](form-event-code.md) and testing whether it returns the On Activate event.

**WARNING:** Do not place a command such as [TRACE](trace.md) or [ALERT](alert.md)in the **Activated** phase of the form, as this will cause an endless loop.

**Note:** In order for the **Activated** execution cycle to be generated, make sure that the On Activate event property of the form has been selected in the Design environment.
