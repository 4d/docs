#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SOAP SEND FAULT.Summary-->The **SOAP SEND FAULT** command returns an error to a SOAP client indicating the origin of the fault: client or server.<!-- END REF--> Using this command lets you indicate an error to a client without having to return a result. 

For instance, a fault on the client side may be detected when you publish a “Square\_root” Web Service and a client sends a request with a negative number; you can use this command to indicate to the client that a positive value is required. 

A possible fault on the server side may be, for instance, a lack of memory occurring during method execution. 

Pass the origin of the error in *faultType*. You can use the following predefined constants, located in the *Web Services (Server)* theme:

| Constant          | Type    | Value |
| ----------------- | ------- | ----- |
| SOAP client fault | Longint | 1     |
| SOAP server fault | Longint | 2     |

Pass a description of the error in *description*. If the client implementation is in conformity, the error can be processed. 

#### Example 

To go back to the example of the “Square\_root” Web Service provided in the command description, the following command can be used to process requests with negative numbers:

```4d
 SEND SOAP FAULT(SOAP client fault;"Positive values required")
```
