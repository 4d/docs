#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.COMBINE PICTURES.Summary-->The **COMBINE PICTURES** command combines the *pict1* and *pict2* pictures in *operator* mode in order to produce a third, *resultingPict*.<!-- END REF--> The resulting picture is of the compound type and keeps all the characteristics of the source pictures.

**Note:** This command extends the functionalities offered by the conventional [picture combination operators](../Concepts/dt_picture.md#picture-operators). 

In *operator*, pass the type of combination to be applied. Three types of combinations, which can be accessed via the constants of the “*Picture Transformation*” theme, are proposed:

* Horizontal concatenation (1): *pict2* is attached to *pict1*, the top left corner of *pict2* coincides with the top right corner of *pict1*.
* Vertical concatenation (2): *pict2* attached to *pict1*, the top left corner of *pict2* coincides with the lower left corner of *pict1*.
* Superimposition (3): *pict2* is placed over *pict1*, the top left corner of *pict2* coincides with the top left corner of *pict1*.  
If the optional *horOffset* and *vertOffset* parameters are used, a translation is applied to *pict2* before superimposition. The values passed in *horOffset* and *vertOffset* must correspond to pixels. Pass positive values for an offset to the right or towards the bottom and a negative value for an offset to the left or towards the top.

**Note:** Superimposition carried out by the **COMBINE PICTURES** command differs from the superimposition provided by the conventional & and |operators (exclusive and inclusive superimposition). While the **COMBINE PICTURES** command preserves the characteristics of each source picture in the resulting picture, the & and | operators process each pixel and generate a bitmap picture in all cases. These operators, originally intended for black and white pictures, are now obsolete.

#### Example 

Given the following pictures:

```4d
 COMBINE PICTURES(flag;mybackground;Superimposition;mycircle;50;30)
```

Result:
