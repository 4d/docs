#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET MULTILINE.Summary-->The **OBJECT SET MULTILINE** command modifies the "Multiline" property of the object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters.<!-- END REF-->

The "Multiline" property controls two parameters related to the display and printing of text areas: display of words located at the end of the line in single-line areas and the automatic insertion of line returns. For more information, refer to *Multiline* in the *Design Reference* manual. If you apply this command to an object that does not support this property, the command does nothing. 

Passing the optional *\** parameter indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, it indicates that the *object* parameter is a field or variable. In this case, you pass a field or variable reference instead of a string (field or variable object only).

In the *multiline* parameter, pass the new value of the option that you want to set. You can use the following constants, found in the "*Form Objects (Properties)*" theme:

| Constant       | Type    | Value | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiline Auto | Longint | 0     | In single-line areas, words located at the end of lines are truncated and there are no line returns. <br/>In multiline areas, 4D carries out automatic line returns.                                                                                                                                         |
| Multiline No   | Longint | 2     | There are never line returns: the text is always displayed on a single row. If the Alpha or Text field or variable contains carriage returns, the text located after the first carriage return is removed as soon as the area is modified.                                                                           |
| Multiline Yes  | Longint | 1     | In single-line areas, the text is displayed up to the first carriage return or until the last word that can be displayed entirely. 4D inserts line returns; it is possible to scroll the contents of the area by pressing the down arrow key.<br/>In multiline areas, 4D carries out automatic line returns. |

  
#### Example 

You want to prohibit multiple lines in an entry area:

```4d
Â OBJECT SET MULTILINE(*;"vEntry";Multiline No)
```
