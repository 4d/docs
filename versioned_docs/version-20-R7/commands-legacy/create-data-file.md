#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CREATE DATA FILE.Summary-->The **CREATE DATA FILE** command creates a new data file to disk and replaces the data file opened by the 4D application on-the-fly.<!-- END REF-->

The general functioning of this command is identical to that of the [OPEN DATA FILE](open-data-file.md) command; the only difference is that the new data file set by the *accessPath* parameter is created just after the structure is re-opened.

Before launching the operation, the command verifies that the specified access path does not correspond to an existing file.

**4D Server:** Beginning with 4D v13, this command can be executed with 4D Server. In this context, it performs an internal call to [QUIT 4D](quit-4d.md) on the server (which causes a dialog box to appear on each remote machine, indicating that the server is in the process of quitting) before creating the designated file.
