*This command is not thread-safe, it cannot be used in preemptive code.*


#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.FORM EDIT.Summary-->The **FORM EDIT** command opens the *form* associated to *aTable* in the 4D Form editor.<!-- END REF--> Note that you must have access to the Design environment, otherwise the error -9804 ("Cannot open form") is generated.

The command is asynchronous: it returns immediately to the calling method and does not wait for the form to be open. 

If you pass the optional *aTable* parameter, you indicate the table associated with *form*. If you omit this parameter, you indicate that *form* is a project form.

In the *form* parameter, pass the name of the form to open in the 4D Form editor. If you pass a name that does not exist, the error 81 is generated ("Form not found"). 

#### Example 

To open the *Contacts* table *Address* form:

```4d
 FORM EDIT([Contacts];"Address")
```

To open the *ContactList* project form:

```4d
 FORM EDIT("ContactList")
```
