#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SET DATABASE PARAMETER.Summary-->The **SET DATABASE PARAMETER** command allows you to modify various internal parameters of the 4D database.<!-- END REF-->

The *selector* designates the database parameter to modify. 4D offers predefined constants, which are located in the “*Database Parameters*” theme. The following table lists each constant, describes its scope and indicates whether any changes made are kept between two sessions:

| 4D Server timeout                   | Longint | 13    | **Scope**: 4D application if *value* positive<br/>**Kept between two sessions**: Yes if *value* positive<br/>**Possible values**: 0 -> 32 767<br/>**Description**: Value of the 4D Server timeout. The default 4D Server timeout value is defined on the "Client-Server/Network options" page of the Database settings dialog box on the server side. <br/>The server timeout sets the maximum period "authorized" to wait for a client response, for example when it is executing a blocking operation. After this period, 4D Server disconnects the client. The 4D Server Timeout selector allows you to set, in the corresponding *value*parameter, a new timeout expressed in minutes. This feature is particularly useful to increase the timeout before executing a blocking and time-consuming operation on the client, such as printing a large number of pages, which can cause an unexpected timeout.<br/>You also have two options:<br/>If you pass a **positive** value in the *value*parameter, you set a global and permanent timeout: the new value is applied to all process and is stored in the preferences of the 4D application (equivalent to change in the Preferences dialog box).If you pass a **negative** value in the *value*parameter, you set a local and temporary timeout: The new value is applied to the calling process only (the other processes keep the default values) and is reset to default as soon as the server receives any signal of activity from the client — for example, when the operation is finished. This option is useful for managing long operations initiated by 4D plug-ins. To set the "No timeout" option, pass 0 in *value*. See example 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4D Remote mode timeout              | Longint | 14    | **Scope** (legacy network layer only): 4D application if *value* positive<br/>**Kept between two sessions**: Yes if *value* positive<br/>**Description**: To be used in very specific cases. Value of the timeout granted by the remote 4D machine to the 4D Server machine. The default timeout value used by 4D in remote mode is set on the "Client-Server/Network options" page of the Database settings dialog box on the remote machine.<br/>The 4D Remote mode timeout selector is only taken into account if you are using the legacy network.

| 4D Server log recording             | Longint | 28    | **Scope**: 4D Server, 4D remote*<br/>* **Kept between two sessions**: No<br/>**Possible values**: 0 or from 1 to X (0 = do not record, 1 to X = sequential number, added to the file name).<br/>**Description**: Starts or stops the recording of standard requests received by 4D Server (excluding Web requests). By default, the value is 0 (requests not recorded).<br/>4D Server lets you record each request received by the server machine in a log file. When this mechanism is enabled, two files are created in the Logs folder of the database. They are named *4DRequestsLogServer\_X*.txt and *4DRequestsLog\_ProcessInfoServer\_X*.txt on the server, and *4DRequestsLog\_X*.txt and *4DRequestsLog\_ProcessInfo\_X*.txt on the remote, where X is the sequential number of the log. Once a file has reached a size of 10 MB, it is closed and a new one is generated, with an incremented sequential number. If a file of the same name already exists, it is replaced directly. You can set the starting number of the sequence using the *value* parameter. These text files store various information concerning each request in a simple tabbed format: time, process number, size of request, processing duration, etc. For more information on the 4DRequestsLog files, please refer to the *Description of log files* section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If you only want to set values for certain client machines, use the Preferences dialog box of 4D in remote mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Table sequence number               | Longint | 31    | **Scope**:4D application<br/> **Kept between two sessions**: Yes<br/> **Possible values**: Any longint value.<br/>**Description**: Command SET DATABASE PARAMETERThis selector is used to modify or get the current unique number for records of the table passed as parameter. "Current number" means "last number used": if you modify this value using [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md), the next record will be created with a number that consists of the value passed + 1\. This new number is the one returned by the [Sequence number](sequence-number.md) command as well in any field of the table to which the "Autoincrement" property has been assigned in the Structure editor or via SQL.<br/>By default, this unique number is set by 4D and corresponds to the order of record creation. For additional information, refer to the documentation of the [Sequence number](sequence-number.md) command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Debug log recording                 | Longint | 34    | **Scope**: 4D application<br/>Kept between two **sessions**: No<br/>**Description**: Starts or stops the sequential recording of events occurring at the 4D programming level in the *4DDebugLog\[\_n\].txt* file or *4DDebugLogServer\[\_n\].txt* (where \_n is the segment number of the file and *Server* is added to the file name when generated on the server). Two modes are available:<br/>- Standard mode provides a basic view of events and the file is automatically placed in the Logs subfolder of the database, next to the structure file. Execution times are expressed in milliseconds with the "< ms" value displayed when an operation lasts less than one millisecond. <br/>- Tabbed mode provides additional information and uses a more compact, tabbed format in the file. Execution times are expressed in microseconds.<br/>**Possible values**: Longint containing a bit field: value = bit1(1)+bit2(2)+bit3(4)+bit4(8)+…). <br/>- Bit 0 (value 1) requests to enable the file (note that any other non-null value also enables it as well)<br/>- Bit 1 (value 2) requests call parameters to commands and (interpreted mode only) methods<br/>- Bit 2 (value 4) enables tabbed format.<br/>- Bit 3 (value 8) disables immediate writing of each operation on disk (enabled by default). Immediate writing is slower but more effective, for example for investigating causes of a crash. If you disable this mode, the file contents are generated more quickly.<br/>- Bit 4 (value 16) disables recording of plug-in calls (enabled by default).<br/>- Bit 5 (value 32) disables member function logging.<br/>Examples:<br/>SET DATABASE PARAMETER (34;1) // enables standard mode without parameters, with runtimes<br/>SET DATABASE PARAMETER (34;2) // enables standard mode with parameters and runtimes<br/>SET DATABASE PARAMETER (34;2+4) // enables tabbed mode with parameters and runtimes<br/>SET DATABASE PARAMETER (34;0) // disables file<br/>For any type of interpreted or compiled 4D application (4D all modes, 4D Server, 4D Volume Desktop), you can avoid having a file record too much information by:<br/>- restricting the 4D commands that are examined by using Log command list (selector 80), or <br/>- restricting it to the current process only with Current process debug log recording (selector 111). This will add the letter "p" and the process number to the file name: *4DDebugLog\[\_pn\_n\].txt*  or *4DDebugLogServer\[\_pn\_n\].txt* *<br/>*For more information about this format and on the use of the *4DDebugLog* file, please refer to the *Description of log files* section..**<br/>Note:** This selector is provided solely for the purpose of debugging and should be used with care since it can impact the application performance. <br/><br/> |
| Client Server port ID               | Longint | 35    | **Scope**:Database <br/> **Kept between two** **sessions**: Yes<br/> **Possible values**: 0 to 65535<br/>**Description**: TCP port number where the 4D Server publishes the database (bound for 4D remote machines). By default, the value is 19813\. <br/>Customizing this value means that several 4D client-server applications can be used on the same machine with the TCP protocol; in this case, you must indicate a different port number for each application.<br/>The value is stored in the database structure file. It can be set with 4D in local mode but is only taken into account in client-server configuration.<br/>When you modify this value, it is necessary to restart the server machine in order for the new value to be taken into account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Client log recording                | Longint | 45    | **Scope**: Remote 4D machine <br/>Kept between two **sessions**: No<br/>**Possible values**: 0 or from 1 to X (0 = do not record, 1 to X = sequential number, attached to file name). <br/>**Description**: Starts or stops recording of standard requests carried out by the 4D client machine that executed the command (excluding Web requests). By default, the value is 0 (no recording of requests). <br/>4D lets you record the log of requests carried out by the client machine. When this mechanism is activated, two files are created on the client machine, in the Logs subfolder of the local folder of the database. They are named 4DRequestsLog\_X.txt and 4DRequestsLog\_ProcessInfo\_X.txt, where X is the sequential number of the log. Once the file 4DRequestsLog has reached a size of 10 MB, it is closed and a new one is generated, with an incremented sequential number. If a file with the same name already exists, it is directly replaced. You can set the starting number for the sequence using the value parameter.<br/>These text files store various information concerning each request in a simple tabbed format: time, process number, size of request, processing duration, etc. For more information on the 4DRequestsLog files, please refer to the *Description of log files* section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In converted databases, these commands are executed on the client machine, as in previous versions of 4D.In converted databases, a specific preference (Application/Compatibility page) can be used to globally modify the execution location of these commands.This difference in execution location influences not only application performance (execution on the server is usually faster) but also programming. In fact, the value of the components of the formula (in particular variables called via a method) differ according to the execution context. You can use this selector to punctually adapt the operation of your application. <br/>If you pass 0 in the *value* l’parameter, the execution location of query "by formula" commands will depend on the database configuration: in databases created with 4D v11 SQL, these commands will be executed on the server. In converted databases, they will be executed on the client machine or the server according to the database preferences. Pass 1 or 2 in *value* to "force" the execution of these commands, respectively, on the client or on the server machine.<br/>Refer to example 2.<br/>**Note:** If you want to be able to enable "SQL type" joins (see the QUERY BY FORMULA Joins selector), you must always execute formulas on the server so that they have access to the records. Be careful, in this context, the formula must not contain any calls to a method, otherwise it will automatically be switched to the remote machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Be careful, in this context, the formula must not contain any calls to a method, otherwise it will automatically be switched to the remote machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Query by formula joins              | Longint | 49    | **Scope**:Current process<br/> **Kept between two** **sessions**: No<br/> **Possible values**: 0 (use database configuration), 1 (always use automatic relations) or 2 (use SQL joins if possible).<br/>**Description**: Operating mode of the [QUERY BY FORMULA](query-by-formula.md) and [QUERY SELECTION BY FORMULA](query-selection-by-formula.md) commands relating to the use of "SQL joins."<br/>In databases created starting with version 11.2 of 4D v11 SQL, these commands carry out joins based on the SQL joins model. This mechanism can be used to modify the selection of a table according to a query carried out on another table without these tables being connected by an automatic relation (necessary condition in previous versions of 4D).<br/>The QUERY BY FORMULA Joins selector lets you specify the operating mode of the query by formula commands for the current process:<br/>0: Uses the current settings of the database (default value). In databases created starting with version 11.2 of 4D v11 SQL, "SQL joins" are always activated for queries by formula. In converted databases, this mechanism is not activated by default for compatibility reasons but can be implemented via a preference.1: Always use automatic relations (= functioning of previous versions of 4D). In this mode, a relation is necessary in order to set the selection of a table according to queries carried out on another table. 4D does not do "SQL joins."2: Use SQL joins if possible (= default operation of databases created in version 11.2 and higher of 4D v11 SQL ). In this mode, 4D establishes "SQL joins" for queries by formula when the formula is suited for it (with two notable exceptions, see the description of the [QUERY BY FORMULA](query-by-formula.md) or [QUERY SELECTION BY FORMULA](query-selection-by-formula.md) command).**Note:** With 4D in remote mode, "SQL joins" can only be used if the formulas are executed on the server (they must have access to the records).

| Server base process stack size      | Longint | 53    | **Scope**: 4D Server<br/> Kept between two **sessions**: No<br/> **Possible values**: Positive longint.<br/>**Description**: Size of the stack allocated to each preemptive system process on the server, expressed in bytes. The default size is determined by the system.<br/>Preemptive system processes (processes of the 4D client base process type) are loaded to control the main 4D client processes. The size allocated by default to the stack of each preemptive process allows a good ease of execution but may prove to be consequential when very large numbers of processes (several hundred) are created. <br/>For optimization purposes, this size can be reduced considerably if the operations carried out by the database allow for it (for example if the database does not carry out sorts of large quantities of records). Values of 512 or even 256 KB are possible. Be careful, under-sizing the stack is critical and can be harmful to the operation of 4D Server. Setting this parameter should be done with caution and must take the database conditions of use into account (number of records, type of operations, etc.). <br/>In order to be taken into account, this parameter must be executed on the server machine (for example in the *On Server Startup Database Method*).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Idle connections timeout            | Longint | 54    | **Scope**:4D application unless value is negative<br/>**Kept between two** **sessions**: No<br/>**Possible values**: Whole value expressing a duration in seconds. The value can be positive (new connections) or negative (existing connections). By default, the value is 20.<br/>**Description**: Maximum period of inactivity (timeout) for connections to both the 4D database engine and the SQL engine, as well as, in *ServerNet* mode (new network layer), to the 4D application server. When an idle connection reaches this limit, it is automatically put on standby, which freezes the client/server session and closes the network socket. In the server administration window, the state of the user process is indicated as "Postponed". This functioning is completely transparent for the user: as soon as there is new activity on the connection which is on standby, the socket is automatically reopened and the client/server session is restored. <br/>On the one hand, this setting lets you save resources on the server: connections on standby close the socket and free up a process on the server. On the other hand, it lets you avoid losing connections due to the closing of idle sockets by the firewall. For this, the timeout value for idle connections must be lower than that of the firewall in this case. <br/>If you pass a positive value in *value*, it applies to all new connections in all the processes. If you pass a negative value, it applies to connections that are open in the current process. If you pass 0, idle connections are not subjected to a timeout.<br/>This parameter must be set on the client side. Usually, you do not need to change this value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| SSL cipher list                     | Longint | 64    | **Scope**: 4D application<br/>Kept between two **sessions**: No<br/>**Possible values**: Sequence of strings separated by colons.<br/>**Description:** Cipher list used by 4D for the secure protocol. This list modifies the priority of ciphering algorithms implemented by 4D. For example, you can pass the following string in the *value* parameter: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!3DES:!CAMELLIA:!AES128:!RSA:!DH:!RC4". For a complete description of the syntax for the ciphers list, refer to the *ciphers page of the OpenSSL*   *site*.<br/>This setting applies to the main Web server (excluding Web server objects), the SQL server, client/server connections, as well as the HTTP client and all the 4D commands that make use of the secure protocol. It is temporary (it is not maintained between sessions). <br/>When the cipher list has been modified, you will need to restart the server concerned in order for the new settings to be taken into account.<br/>To reset the cipher list to its default value (stored permanently in the SLI file), call the [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md) command and pass an empty string ("") in the *value* parameter. <br/>**Note:** With the [Get database parameter](get-database-parameter.md) command, the cipher list is returned in the optional *stringValue* parameter and the return parameter is always 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

By default, the value is 0 (do not record).<br/>4D can continuously record a set of events related to the internal application operation into a diagnostic file. Information contained in this file is intended for the development of 4D applications and can be analyzed with the help of the 4D tech support (for more information, please refer to the *Description of log files* section on *developer.4d.com*). When you pass 1 in this selector, a diagnostic file is automatically created (or opened) in the database **Logs** folder. The file is named *4DDiagnosticLog\_X*.txt (or *4DDiagnosticLogServer\_X*.txt if generated on the server). Once this file reaches a size of 10 MB, it is closed and a new file is generated, with an incremented sequence number X. <br/>Note that you can include custom information in this file using the [LOG EVENT](log-event.md) command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Dates inside objects                | Longint | 85    | Scope: Current process<br/> Kept between two **sessions**: No<br/> **Possible values**: String type without time zone (0), String type with time zone (1), Date type (2) (default)<br/>**Description**: Defines the way dates are stored within objects, as well as how they will be imported/exported in JSON. <br/>When the selector value is Date type (default value for databases created with 4D v17 and higher), 4D dates are stored with the date type within objects, with respect to the local date settings. When converted to JSON format, date attributes will be converted to strings which do not include a time. (**Note:** this setting can be set by means of the "Use date type instead of ISO date format in objects" option found on the *Compatibility page* of the Database Settings).<br/>Passing String type with time zone in this selector will convert 4D dates into ISO strings and take the local time zone into account. For example, converting the date 23/08/2013 gives you "2013-08-22T22:00:000Z" in JSON format when the operation is performed in France during Daylight Savings Time (GMT+2). This principle conforms to the standard operation of JavaScript. This can be a source of errors when you want to send JSON date values to someone in a different time zone. For example, when you export a table using [Selection to JSON](selection-to-json.md) in France that is meant to be reimported in the US using [JSON TO SELECTION](json-to-selection.md). Since dates are re-interpreted in each time zone, the values stored in the database will be different. In this case, you can modify the conversion mode for dates so that they do not take the time zone into account by passing String type without time zone in this selector. Converting the date 23/08/2013 will then give you "2013-08-23T00:00:00Z" in all cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Use legacy network layer            | Longint | 87    | **Scope**: 4D in local mode, 4D Server<br/>**Kept between two sessions**: Yes<br/>**Description:** Sets or gets the current status of the legacy network layer for client/server connections. The legacy network layer is obsolete beginning with 4D v14 R5 and should be replaced progressively in your applications with the *ServerNet* network layer. *ServerNet* will be required in upcoming 4D releases in order to benefit from future network evolutions. For compatibility reasons, the legacy network layer is still supported to allow a smooth transition for existing applications; (it is used by default in applications converted from a release prior to v14 R5). Pass 1 in this parameter to use the legacy network layer (and disable *ServerNet*) for your client/server connections, and pass 0 to disable the legacy network (and use the *ServerNet*). <br/>This property can also be set by means of the "Use legacy network layer" option found on the *Compatibility page* of the Database Settings (see *Network and Client-Server options*). In this section, you will also find a discussion about migration strategy. We recommend that you activate the *ServerNet* as soon as possible. You will need to restart the application in order for this parameter to be taken into account. <br/>**Possible values:** 0 or 1 (0 = do not use legacy layer, 1 = use legacy layer)<br/>**Default value:** 0 in databases created with 4D v14 R5 or higher, 1 in databases converted from 4D v14 R4 or earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This setting applies to all log files, i.e. request logs (selectors 28 and 45), debug log (selector 34), events log (selector 79), Web logs (selectors 29 and 84 of the [WEB SET OPTION](web-set-option.md) command), etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Number of formulas in cache         | Longint | 92    | **Scope**: 4D application<br/>**Kept between two sessions**: No<br/>**Possible values**: Positive longints<br/>**Default value**: 0 (no cache) <br/>**Description**: Sets or gets the maximum number of formulas to be kept in the cache of formulas, which is used by the [EXECUTE FORMULA](execute-formula.md) command. This limit is applied to all processes, but each process has its own formula cache. Caching formulas accelerates the [EXECUTE FORMULA](execute-formula.md) command execution in compiled mode since each cached formula is tokenized only once in this case. When you change the cache value, existing contents are reset even if the new size is larger than the previous one. Once the maximum number of formulas in the cache is reached, a new executed formula will erase the oldest one in the cache (FIFO mode). This parameter is only taken into account in compiled databases or compiled components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Remote connection sleep timeout     | Longint | 98    | **Scope**: 4D Server application<br/>**Kept between two sessions**: No<br/>**Possible values**: Positive longint<br/>**Description**: Current remote connection sleep timeout in seconds. By default, the value is 172800 (48 hours). <br/>The sleep timeout is applied after a machine running a 4D remote application has switched to sleep mode. In this case, its session is maintained by 4D Server (see feature description). 4D Server checks every 5 minutes if any sleeping remote 4D has exceeded the sleep timeout, in which case it is dropped. Thus, the maximum allowed sleeping time is *current sleep timeout + 300*. In some cases, you might want to modify the sleep timeout, for example to release locked records/licenses more rapidely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| User param value                    | Longint | 108   | **Scope:** 4D local, 4D Server<br/>**Kept between two sessions:** No<br/>**Possible values**: Any custom string<br/>**Description:** Custom string passed from one session to the next one when the 4D application is restarted. This selector is useful in the context of automated unit tests that require applications to restart with different parameters. <br/>When used with [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md), defines a new value that will be available within the next opened database after 4D is restarted manually or using the [OPEN DATABASE](open-database.md)(\*), [OPEN DATA FILE](open-data-file.md), or [RESTART 4D](restart-4d.md) commands. When used with [Get database parameter](get-database-parameter.md), gets the currently available user parameter value, defined using a command line (see *Command Line Interface*), the .4DLink file (see *Using a 4DLink file*), or a call to [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md) during the previous session. (\*) If [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md) sets a User param value before a call to [OPEN DATABASE](open-database.md) with a .4DLink file that also contains a user-param xml attribute, 4D takes into account only the parameter provided by [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Using this selector can help you migrating your applications by reverting to previous settings if necessary.<br/>**Note**: ORDA methods and SQL engine ignore this setting, they always assume time values to be numbers of seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| SMTP Log                            | Longint | 110   | **Scope**: 4D local, 4D Server*<br/>* **Kept between two sessions**: No<br/> **Possible values**: 0 or from 1 to X (0 = do not record, 1 to X = sequential number, added to the file name). By default, the value is 0 (SMTP exchanges not recorded).<br/>**Description**: Starts or stops the recording of exchanges between 4D and the SMTP server, when a *transporter* object is processed through *transporter.send( )* or *SMTP\_transporter.checkConnection( )*. By default, the value is 0 (exchanges not recorded). When this mechanism is enabled, a log file is created in the Logs folder of the database. It is named 4DSMTPLog\_X.txt, where *X* is the sequential number of the log. Once the file 4DSMTPLog has reached a size of 10 MB, it is closed and a new one is generated, with an incremented sequential number. If a file of the same name already exists, it is replaced directly. You can set the starting number of the sequence using the *value* parameter. By default, all files are kept, but you can control the number of files to keep using the Circular log limitation parameter. <br/>For more information on the 4DSMTPLog\_X.txt files, please refer to the *Description of log files* section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Current process debug log recording | Longint | 111   | **Scope:** 4D application<br/>**Kept between two sessions:** No<br/>**Description**: Starts or stops the sequential recording of programming events **for the current process** in a separated log file. This log is similar to the Debug log recording (selector 34) but focuses on the current process only. The log file name includes the letter "p" and the process number: 4DDebugLog\[\_p*N*\_*n*\].txt, where N is the process unique ID. <br/>For more information about this format and on the use of the *4DDebugLog* file, please refer to *Description of log files* in the Design Reference. <br/>**Notes:** This selector is provided solely for the purpose of debugging and should be used with care. In particular, it must not put into production since it can have an impact on the application performance.

| POP3 Log                            | Longint | 116   | **Scope:** 4D local, 4D Server<br/>**Kept between two sessions:** No<br/>**Possible values:** 0 or from 1 to X (0 = do not record, 1 to X = sequential number, added to the file name). By default, the value is 0 (POP3 exchanges not recorded).<br/>**Description**: Starts or stops the recording of exchanges between 4D and the POP3 server, when a transporter object is processed through *POP3\_transporter.getMail( )* or *POP3\_transporter.checkConnection( )*. By default, the value is 0 (exchanges not recorded). When this mechanism is enabled, a log file is created in the Logs folder of the database. It is named 4DPOP3Log\_X.txt, where X is the sequential number of the log. Once the file 4DPOP3Log has reached a size of 10 MB, it is closed and a new one is generated, with an incremented sequential number. If a file of the same name already exists, it is replaced directly. You can set the starting number of the sequence using the value parameter. By default, all files are kept, but you can control the number of files to keep using the Circular log limitation parameter. <br/>For more information on the 4DPOP3Log\_X.txt files, please refer to the *Description of log files* section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

By default, all files are kept, but you can control the number of files to keep using the Circular log limitation parameter.<br/>For more information on the 4DIMAPLog\_X.txt files, please refer to the *Description of log files* section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Notes:** 

* The *table* parameter is only used by selectors 31, 46 and 47\. In all other cases, it is ignored if it is passed.
* If a setting is not kept between sessions, but you want to ensure that it's always applied, you can execute it in the [On Startup database method](on-startup-database-method.md) or [On Server Startup database method](on-server-startup-database-method.md).

#### Thread-safe selectors 

The **SET DATABASE PARAMETER** command can be used in preemptive processes when calling the following selectors:

* 4D Server log recording
* Debug log recording
* Diagnostic log recording
* Diagnostic log level
* Circular log limitation
* Cache flush periodicity
* SMTP Log
* POP3 Log
* IMAP Log
* Pause logging

#### Example 1 

The following statement will avoid any unexpected timeout:

```4d
  //Increasing the timeout to 3 hours for the current process
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(4D Server Timeout;-60*3)
  //Executing a time-consuming operation with no control from 4D
 ...
 WR PRINT MERGE(Area;3;0)
 ...
```

#### Example 2 

This example temporarily forces the execution of a query by formula command on the client machine:

```4d
 curVal:=Get database parameter([table1];Query By Formula On Server) //Store the current setting
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER([table1];Query By Formula On Server;1) //Force execution on the client machine
 QUERY BY FORMULA([table1];myformula)
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER([table1];Query By Formula On Server;curVal) //Re-establish current setting
```

#### Example 3 

You want to export data in JSON that contains a converted 4D date. Note that conversion occurs when the date is saved in the object, so you must call the [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](set-database-parameter.md) command before calling [OB SET](ob-set.md): 

```4d
 var $o : Object
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(Dates inside objects;0)
 OB SET($o ;"myDate";Current date) // JSON conversion
 $json:=JSON Stringify($o)
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(Dates inside objects;1)
```
