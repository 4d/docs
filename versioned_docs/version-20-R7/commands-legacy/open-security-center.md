*This command is not thread-safe, it cannot be used in preemptive code.*


#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OPEN SECURITY CENTER.Summary-->The OPEN SECURITY CENTER command displays the Maintenance and Security Center (MSC) window.<!-- END REF--> For more information, please refer to the *Maintenance and security center* page. 

**Notes:** 

* This command works on the same principle as a call to [DIALOG](dialog.md) with the *\** parameter: the MSC is displayed in a window and the command immediately returns control to the 4D code. If the current process finishes, the window is automatically closed by simulating a [CANCEL](cancel.md). So you need to manage its display through the code of the process being executed.
* This command cannot be executed on a remote 4D application.
