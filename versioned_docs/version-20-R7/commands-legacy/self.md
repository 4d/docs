*This command is not thread-safe, it cannot be used in preemptive code.*


#### Compatibility Note 

<!--REF #_command_.Self.Summary-->This command is kept only for compatibility reasons.<!-- END REF--> Starting with version 12 of 4D, it is recommended to use the [OBJECT Get pointer](object-get-pointer.md) command.

#### Description 

The **Self**  command returns a pointer to the object whose object method is currently being executed. 

**Self** is used to reference a variable within its own object method. It returns a valid pointer when it is called from within an object method or from within a project method that is called directly or indirectly by an object method. 

If **Self** is called out of context, it returns a [Is nil pointer](is-nil-pointer.md) pointer (*\->\[\]*).

**Tip:** **Self** is useful when several objects on a form need to perform the same task, yet operate on themselves.

**Note:** When it is used in the context of a list box, the function returns a pointer to the list box or the column of the list box depending on the context. For more information, please refer to the *Managing List Box Objects* section.

#### Example 

See the example for the [RESOLVE POINTER](resolve-pointer.md) command.
