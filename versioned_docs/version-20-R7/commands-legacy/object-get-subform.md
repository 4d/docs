#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT GET SUBFORM.Summary-->The **OBJECT GET SUBFORM** command gets the name(s) of the form(s) associated with the subform object designated by the *object* and *\** parameters.<!-- END REF-->

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, this indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (a string). If you do not pass this parameter, this indicates that the *object* is a variable. In this case, you pass a variable reference instead of a string. 

In the *tablePtr* parameter, the command returns a pointer to the table of the form(s) used. If the subform uses a project form, this parameter contains [Is nil pointer](is-nil-pointer.md). 

In the *detailSubform* and (optionally) *listSubform* parameters, the command returns:

* the form name if the subform was created in the 4D form editor.
* the subform's "name" attribute if the subform was created from a .json file or a 4D object.  
In both cases, if the "name" attribute is undefined, the command will return:  
   * for a .json file, the name of the .json file (without extension)  
   * for an object, "untitled"

If there is no list form, an empty string is returned in the *listSubform* parameter.
