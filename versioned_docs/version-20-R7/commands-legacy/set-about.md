#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SET ABOUT.Summary-->The **SET ABOUT** command changes the **About 4D** menu command in the **Help** menu (Windows) or in the **Application** menu (macOS) menu to *itemText*.<!-- END REF--> 

After the call, when a user selects this menu command in Design or Application mode, *method* will be called. Typically, this method can open a dialog box to give version information about your application.

This command is used with 4D (all modes), 4D Desktop and 4D Server. A new process is created when it is run on a server machine.

**Note:** On Windows, this command modifies the "About 4D" line in the **Help** menu created by the [SET HELP MENU](set-help-menu.md) command. 

#### Example 1 

The following example replaces the **About** menu command with the **About Scheduler** menu command. The ABOUT method displays a custom About box:

```4d
 SET ABOUT("About Scheduler…";"ABOUT")
```

#### Example 2 

The following example resets the About 4D menu command:

```4d
 SET ABOUT("About 4D";"")
```
