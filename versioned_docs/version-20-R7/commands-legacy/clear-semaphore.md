#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CLEAR SEMAPHORE.Summary-->**CLEAR SEMAPHORE** erases *semaphore* previously set by the [Semaphore](semaphore.md) function.<!-- END REF-->

As a rule, all semaphores that have been created should be cleared. If semaphores are not cleared, they remain in memory until the process that creates them ends. A process can only clear semaphores that it has created. If you try to clear a semaphore from within a process that did not create it, nothing happens.

#### Example 

See the example for [Semaphore](semaphore.md).
