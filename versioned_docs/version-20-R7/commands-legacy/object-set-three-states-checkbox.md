#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET THREE STATES CHECKBOX.Summary-->The **OBJECT SET THREE STATES CHECKBOX** command modifies, for the current process, the "Three-States" property of the checkbox(es) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters.<!-- END REF--> 

The "Three-states" option allows the additional "semi-checked" state to be used for checkboxes. For more information, refer to *Three-States check box* in the *Design Reference* manual. 

Passing the optional *\** parameter indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, it indicates that the *object* parameter is a field or variable. In this case, you pass a field or variable reference instead of a string (field or variable object only). 

This command only applies to checkboxes associated with variables, and not to Boolean fields that are represented as checkboxes. 

In the *threeStates* parameter, pass **True** to enable the "three states" mode, or **False** to disable it.
