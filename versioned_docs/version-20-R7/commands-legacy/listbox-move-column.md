#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.LISTBOX MOVE COLUMN.Summary-->The **LISTBOX MOVE COLUMN** command moves the column designated by the *object* and *\** parameters by programming in the context of the form being executed (Application mode).<!-- END REF--> The original form, generated in the Design mode, is not modified. 

The *object* and *\** parameters designate the column to move. Passing the optional *\** parameter indicates that the *object* parameter is a column name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, this indicates that the *object* parameter is a column variable. In this case, you pass a variable reference instead of a string. 

The column is moved to just in front of the one designated by the *colPosition* parameter. If the *colPosition* parameter is greater than the total number of columns, then the column is moved to just after the last column.

**Note:** This command does nothing when it is applied to the first column of a list box displayed in hierarchical mode.

The command takes the static and locked column properties into account: for example, if you try to move a static column, the command does nothing. 

This functionality was already found in 4D in Application mode: the user can move non-static columns using the mouse. However, unlike columns moved by the user, this command does not generate the On Column Moved event. 

#### Example 

You want to swap the 2nd and 3rd columns of the list box:

```4d
Â LISTBOX MOVE COLUMN(*;"column2";3)
```
