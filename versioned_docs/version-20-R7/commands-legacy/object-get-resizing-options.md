#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT GET RESIZING OPTIONS.Summary-->The **OBJECT GET RESIZING OPTIONS** command returns the current resizing options for the object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters for the current process.<!-- END REF-->

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, this indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (a string). If you do not pass this parameter, this indicates that the *object* is a variable. In this case, you pass a variable reference instead of a string.

The command returns the current resizing options, as set in the Design mode or for the process using the [OBJECT SET RESIZING OPTIONS](object-set-resizing-options.md) command. These options specify the display of the object when the form window is resized.

The *horizontal* parameter returns a value indicating the horizontal resizing option that is set for the object. You can compare the value received with the following constants, found in the *Form Objects (Properties)* theme:

| Constant               | Type    | Value | Comment                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resize horizontal grow | Longint | 1     | If the window grows by 50% in width, the object is expanded by 50% to the right.              |
| Resize horizontal move | Longint | 2     | If the window grows by 100 pixels in width, the object is moved 100 pixels to the right.      |
| Resize horizontal none | Longint | 0     | If the window is expanded in width, neither the width nor the position of the object changes. |

The *vertical* parameter returns a value indicating the vertical resizing option that is set for the object. You can compare the value received with the following constants, found in the *Form Objects (Properties)* theme:

| Constant             | Type    | Value | Comment                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resize vertical grow | Longint | 1     | If the window grows by 50% in height, the object is lengthened by 50% towards the bottom.       |
| Resize vertical move | Longint | 2     | If the window grows by 100 pixels in height, the object is moved 100 pixels towards the bottom. |
| Resize vertical none | Longint | 0     | If the window is expanded in height, neither the height nor the position of the object changes. |
