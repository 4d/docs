#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.GET PICTURE RESOURCE.Summary-->The **GET PICTURE RESOURCE** command returns in the picture field or variable *resData* the picture stored in the picture (“PICT”) resource whose ID is passed in *resID*.<!-- END REF-->

If the resource is not found, the *resData* parameter is left unchanged, and the OK variable is set to 0 (zero). 

If you pass a valid resource file reference number in *resFile*, the resource is searched for in that file only. If you do not pass *resFile*, the first occurrence of the resource found in the resource files chain is returned.

**Note:** A picture resource can be at least several megabytes in size.

#### Example 

See example for the [RESOURCE LIST](resource-list.md) command.

#### System variables and sets 

If the resource is found, OK is set to 1\. Otherwise, it is set to 0 (zero).

#### Error management 

If there is not enough memory to load the picture, an error is generated. You can catch this error with an error-handling method installed using [ON ERR CALL](on-err-call.md).
