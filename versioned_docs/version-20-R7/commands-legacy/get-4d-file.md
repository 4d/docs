| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| file | Integer | &#8594;  | File type |

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Get 4D file.Summary-->The **Get 4D file** command returns the pathname to the 4D environment file specified by the *file* parameter.<!-- END REF--> The path is returned using the system syntax. 

This command allows you to get the actual pathname of specific files, whose name or location can depend on database context. It also helps you to write generic code which is independent from the 4D version or the OS. 

In *file*, pass a value to specify the file for which you want to get the full pathname. You can use one of the following constants, located in the "*4D Environment*" theme:

| Constant                          | Type    | Value | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If the target *file* does not exist, an empty path is returned. No errors are raised.

When the command is called from a component, pass the optional *\** parameter to get the *file* path of the host database. In this case, if you omit the *\** parameter, an empty string is always returned. 

Regarding User settings file for data and User settings file, a path is returned only if the **Enable User Settings in External File** security option has been checked in the "Database Settings" dialog box (see ). 

#### Example 

You want to get the path of the last backup file:

```4d
 var $path : Text
 $path:=Get 4D file(Last backup file)
  // $path = "C:\Backups\Countries\Countries[0025].4BK" for example
```
