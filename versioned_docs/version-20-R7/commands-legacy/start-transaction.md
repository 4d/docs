#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.START TRANSACTION.Summary-->START TRANSACTION starts a transaction in the current process.<!-- END REF--> All changes to the data (records) of the database within the transaction are stored temporarily until the transaction is accepted (validated) or canceled.

Beginning with version 11 of 4D, you can nest several transactions (sub-transactions). Each transaction or sub-transaction must eventually be cancelled or validated. Note that if the main transaction is cancelled, all the sub-transactions are cancelled as well, regardless of their result.
