#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.QUERY SELECTION WITH ARRAY.Summary-->The **QUERY SELECTION WITH ARRAY** command searches the table of the field passed as first parameter for the records where the value of *targetField* is equal to at least one of the values of the elements in the *array*.<!-- END REF--> The records found will become the new current selection.

**QUERY SELECTION WITH ARRAY** functions in the same way as [QUERY WITH ARRAY](query-with-array.md). The difference between these two commands is the scope of the search:

* [QUERY WITH ARRAY](query-with-array.md) searches all the records of the table containing *targetField*.
* **QUERY SELECTION WITH ARRAY** only searches the records of the current selection of the table containing *targetField*.

For more information, please refer to the description of the [QUERY WITH ARRAY](query-with-array.md) command.
