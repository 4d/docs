#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.DELETE MENU ITEM.Summary-->The **DELETE MENU ITEM** command deletes the menu item whose menu number or reference is passed in *menu* and whose item number is passed in *menuItem*.<!-- END REF--> You can pass -1 in *menuItem* in order to indicate the last item added to *menu*.

If the menu item specified by *menu* and *menuItem* is itself a menu managed by reference and created, for example, using the [Create menu](create-menu.md) command, **DELETE MENU ITEM** will only delete the instance of the *menuItem* in *menu*. The submenu referenced by the *menuItem* will continue to exist in memory. You must use the [RELEASE MENU](release-menu.md) command in order to definitively delete a menu that is managed by reference. 

This command also works with a menu bar created using the [Create menu](create-menu.md) command and installed with the [SET MENU BAR](set-menu-bar.md) command.

If you omit the *process* parameter, **DELETE MENU ITEM** applies to the menu bar for the current process. Otherwise, **DELETE MENU ITEM** applies to the menu bar for the process whose reference number is passed in *process*. 

**Note:** If you pass a [MenuRef](# "Unique ID (16-character alphanumeric) of a menu") in *menu*, the *process* parameter serves no purpose and will be ignored.

**Note:** For consistency in the user interface, do not keep a menu with no items.
