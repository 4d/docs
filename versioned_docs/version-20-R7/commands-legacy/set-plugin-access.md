#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.SET PLUGIN ACCESS.Summary-->The SET PLUGIN ACCESS command sets, by programming, the user group allowed to use each “serialized” plug-in that is installed in the database.<!-- END REF--> This way you can manage how plug-in licenses are used.

**Note:** This can also be done in the Design environment using the Groups editor.

Pass the number of the plug-in to be associated with a group of users in the *plugIn* parameter. Plug-in licenses include 4D Client Web and SOAP licenses. You can pass one of the following constants found in the *Is License Available* theme:

| Constant               | Type    | Value     |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| 4D Client SOAP license | Longint | 808465465 |
| 4D Client Web license  | Longint | 808465209 |
| 4D for OCI license     | Longint | 808465208 |
| 4D ODBC Pro license    | Longint | 808464946 |
| 4D View license        | Longint | 808465207 |
| 4D Write license       | Longint | 808464697 |

Pass the name of the group whose users are authorized to use the plug-in in *group*.

**Notes:** 

* Only one group at a time can be allowed to use a plug-in. When this command is executed, if another group had the plug-in access rights, it loses this privilege.
* Used licenses will remain attached to 4D user accounts in *group* for the whole session, even if they change memberships or if the *group* loses its plug-in access rights.
