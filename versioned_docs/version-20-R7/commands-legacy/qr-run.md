*This command is not thread-safe, it cannot be used in preemptive code.*


#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.QR RUN.Summary-->The **QR RUN** command executes the report *area* whose reference was passed as parameter with the Quick Report current settings, including the output type.<!-- END REF--> You can use the [QR SET DESTINATION](qr-set-destination.md) command to modify the output type.

The report is executed on the table to which the area belongs. When *area* designates an offscreen area, it is necessary to specify the table to be used via the [QR SET REPORT TABLE](qr-set-report-table.md) command.

If you pass an invalid *area* number, the error -9850 will be generated.

**4D Server:** This command can be executed on 4D Server as part of a stored procedure. In this context, make sure that no dialog box appears on the server machine (except for specific requirements). To do this, you need to call the [QR SET DESTINATION](qr-set-destination.md) command with the "\*" parameter. In case of a printer problem (out of paper, printer disconnected, etc.), no error message is generated.
