#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT GET SCROLLBAR.Summary-->The OBJECT GET SCROLLBAR command is used to find out the displayed/hidden status of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars of the object or group of objects designated by *object*.<!-- END REF--> 

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, you indicate that the *object* parameter is an object name (string). If you do not pass this parameter, you indicate that the *object* parameter is a field or a variable. In this case, you pass a field or variable reference (object field or variable only) instead of a string. 

In the *horizontal* and *vertical* parameters, you can pass Boolean or longint type variables:

* When you pass Boolean variables, the value returned reflects the **current** state of the scrollbar:  
   * If the scrollbar has been defined as hidden, the parameter receives False,  
   * If the scrollbar has been defined as displayed, the parameter receives True,  
   * If the scrollbar has been set to automatic mode, the parameter receives either True or False depending on the current display state of the object.
* When you pass longint variables, the value returned reflects the visibility defined for the scrollbar:  
   * If the scrollbar has been defined as hidden, the parameter receives 0,  
   * If the scrollbar has been defined as displayed, the parameter receives 1,  
   * If the scrollbar has been set to automatic mode, the parameter receives 2.

This command can be used with the following form objects:

* Picture or text object fields and variables
* List boxes,
* Hierarchical lists,
* Subforms.
