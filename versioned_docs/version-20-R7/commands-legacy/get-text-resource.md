#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Get text resource.Summary-->The **Get text resource** command returns the text stored in the text (“TEXT”) resource whose ID is passed in *resID*.<!-- END REF-->

If the resource is not found, empty text is returned, and the OK variable is set to 0 (zero).

If you pass a valid resource file reference number in *resFile*, the resource is searched for in that file only. If you do not pass *resFile*, the first occurrence of the resource found in the resource files chain is returned.

**Note:** A text resource can contain up to 32,000 characters.

#### Example 

The following example displays the contents of the text resource ID=20800, which must be located in at least one of the currently open resource files:

```4d
 ALERT(Get text resource(20800))
```

#### System variables and sets 

If the resource is found, OK is set to 1\. Otherwise, it is set to 0 (zero).
