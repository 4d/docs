#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.QR Get drop column.Summary-->The QR Get drop column command returns a value depending on where the drop was performed:

* if the value is negative, it indicates a column number (i.e., -3 if the the drop was performed on column number 3)
* if the value is positive, it indicates that the drop was performed on a separator preceding the column (i.e., 3 if the drop was performed after column 2).<!-- END REF--> Keep in mind that the drop does not have to take place before an existing column.

If you pass an invalid *area* number, the error -9850 will be generated.
