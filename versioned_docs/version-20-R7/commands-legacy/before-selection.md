<!--REF #_command_.Before selection.Syntax-->**Before selection** {( *aTable* )} -> Function result<!-- END REF-->
<!--REF #_command_.Before selection.Params-->
| Parameter | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aTable | Table | &#8594;  | Table for which to test if record pointer is before the first selected record, or Default table, if omitted |
| Function result | Boolean | &#8592; | Yes (TRUE) or No (FALSE) |

<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Before selection.Summary-->**Before selection** returns TRUE when the current record pointer is before the first record of the current selection of *table*.<!-- END REF-->**Before selection** is commonly used to check whether or not [PREVIOUS RECORD](previous-record.md) has moved the current record pointer before the first record. If the current selection is empty, **Before selection** returns TRUE.

To move the current record pointer back into the selection, use [FIRST RECORD](first-record.md), [LAST RECORD](last-record.md) or [GOTO SELECTED RECORD](goto-selected-record.md). [NEXT RECORD](next-record.md) does not move the pointer back into the selection.

**Before selection** also returns TRUE in the first header when a report is being printed with [PRINT SELECTION](print-selection.md) or from the Print menu. You can use the following code to test for the first header and print a special header for the first page:

```4d
  // Method of a form being used as output form for a summary report
 $vpFormTable:=Current form table
 Case of
  // ...
    :(Form event code=On Header)
  // A header area is about to be printed
       Case of
          :(Before selection($vpFormTable->))
  // Code for the first break header goes here
  // ...
       End case
 End case
```

#### Example 

This form method is used during the printing of a report. It sets a variable, *vTitle*, to print in the Header area on the first page:

```4d
  // [Finances];"Summary" Form Method
 Case of
  // ...
    :(Form event code=On Header)
       Case of
          :(Before selection([Finances))
             vTitle:="Corporate Report 1997" // Set the title for the first page
          Else
             vTitle:="" // Clear the title for all other pages
       End case
 End case
```
