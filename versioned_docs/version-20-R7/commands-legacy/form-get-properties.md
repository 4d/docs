#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.FORM GET PROPERTIES.Summary-->The FORM GET PROPERTIES command returns the properties of the form *formName*.<!-- END REF-->

The *width* and *height* parameters return the form’s width and height in pixels. These values are determined from the form’s Default window size properties:

* If the form’s size is **automatic**, its width and height are calculated so that all the form’s objects are visible, by taking into consideration the horizontal and vertical margins that were defined.
* If the form’s size is **set**, its width and height are those manually entered in the corresponding areas.
* If the form’s size is **based on an object**, its width and height are calculated in relation to this object’s position.

The *numPages* parameter returns the number of pages in the form, excluding page 0 (zero).

The *fixedWidth* and *fixedHeight* parameters indicate if the length and width of the form are resizable (the parameter returns **False**) or set (the parameter returns **True**).

The *title* parameter returns the title of the form's window as it was defined in the Property List of the Form editor. If no name was defined, the *title* parameter returns an empty string.
