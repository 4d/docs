#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CLEAR SET.Summary-->**CLEAR SET** clears *set* from memory and frees the memory used by *set*.<!-- END REF--> The command does not affect tables, selections, or records. To save a set before clearing it, use the [SAVE SET](save-set.md) command. Since sets use memory, it is good practice to clear them when they are no longer needed.

#### Example 

See the example for [USE SET](use-set.md).
