#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET FOCUS RECTANGLE INVISIBLE.Summary-->The **OBJECT SET FOCUS RECTANGLE INVISIBLE** command sets or dynamically modifies the visibility option for the focus rectangle of the object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters for the current process.<!-- END REF--> This setting corresponds to the **Hide focus rectangle** option that is available for enterable objects in the Property List in the Design mode. 

**Note:** You can only use this option under Mac OS. It has no effect under Windows. 

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, this indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (a string). If you do not pass this parameter, this indicates that the *object* is a variable or a field. In this case, you pass a variable reference instead of a string. 

Pass **True** in the *invisible* parameter to hide the focus rectangle and **False** to keep it visible.
