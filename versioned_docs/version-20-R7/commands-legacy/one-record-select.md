<!--REF #_command_.ONE RECORD SELECT.Syntax-->**ONE RECORD SELECT** {( *aTable* )}<!-- END REF-->
<!--REF #_command_.ONE RECORD SELECT.Params-->
| Parameter | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| aTable | Table | &#8594;  | Table in which to reduce the selection to the current record, or Default table, if omitted |

<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.ONE RECORD SELECT.Summary-->**ONE RECORD SELECT** reduces the current selection of *aTable* to the current record.<!-- END REF--> If no current record exists or if the current record is not loaded into memory (special case), **ONE RECORD SELECT** has no effect.

#### Note 

This command was useful to “return” a record that had been pushed and popped from the record stack back to the selection while the selection for the table was changed. [SET QUERY DESTINATION](set-query-destination.md) allows you to make a query without changing the selection or the current record of a table; therefore, you no longer need to push and pop a current record in order to query its table. Consequently, **ONE RECORD SELECT** is less useful, unless you actually want to reduce the selection of a table to the current record.

**Warning:** Keep in mind that a record number can be reused if the record is deleted and another record is created (see *About Record Numbers*).
