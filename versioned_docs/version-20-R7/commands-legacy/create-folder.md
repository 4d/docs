<!-- END REF-->

#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.CREATE FOLDER.Summary-->The **CREATE FOLDER** command creates a folder according to the pathname you pass in *folderPath*.<!-- END REF-->

If you pass a name in *folderPath*, the folder is created in the database folder. 

In *folderPath*, you can also pass a folder hierarchy starting from the root of the volume or from the database folder (in this case, the string must end with a folder separator).   
If you omit the *\** parameter, an error is generated and no folder is created if any one of the intermediary folders does not exist.   
If you pass the *\** parameter, **CREATE FOLDER** recreates the folder hierarchy if necessary and no error is generated. In this case, you can also pass a document pathname in *folderPath*. The document name is then ignored but the folder hierarchy specified in *folderPath* is created recursively 

#### Example 1 

The following example creates the “Archives” folder in the folder of the database:

```4d
 CREATE FOLDER("Archives")
```

#### Example 2 

The following example creates the Archives folder in the folder of the database, then it creates the “January” and “February” subfolders:

```4d
 CREATE FOLDER("Archives")
 CREATE FOLDER("Archives\\January")
 CREATE FOLDER("Archives\\February")
```

#### Example 3 

The following example creates the “Archives” folder at the root level of the C volume:

```4d
 CREATE FOLDER("C:\\Archives")
```

#### Example 4 

Creation of the "C:\\Archives\\2011\\January\\" folder hierarchy:

```4d
 CREATE FOLDER("C:\\Archives\\2011\\January\\";*)
```

#### Example 5 

Creation of the "\\February\\" subfolder in the existing "C:\\Archives\\" folder: 

```4d
 CREATE FOLDER("C:\\Archives\\2011\\February\\Doc.txt";*)
  // the "Doc.txt" file is ignored
```
