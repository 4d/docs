#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.Is compiled mode.Summary-->Is compiled mode tests whether you are running in compiled mode (True) or interpreted mode (False).<!-- END REF-->  
  
The optional *\** parameter is useful in the case of an architecture using components: it can be used to determine the database (host or component) for which you want to find out the running mode.  

* When the command is called from a component:  
   * If the *\** parameter is passed, the command returns [True](true.md) or [False](false.md) depending on the mode in which the host database is running,  
   * If the *\** parameter is not passed, the command returns [True](true.md) or [False](false.md) depending on the mode in which the component is running.
* When the command is called from a method of the host database, it returns [True](true.md) or [False](false.md) depending on the mode in which the host database is running.

#### Example 

In one of your routines, you include debugging code useful only when you are running in interpreted mode, so surround this debugging code with a test that calls **Is compiled mode**:

```4d
  // ...
 If(Not(Is compiled mode))
  // Include debugging code here
 End if
  // ...
```
