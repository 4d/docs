#### Description 

<!--REF #_command_.OBJECT SET KEYBOARD LAYOUT.Summary-->The **OBJECT SET KEYBOARD LAYOUT** command sets or dynamically modifies the keyboard layout associated with the object(s) designated by the *object* and *\** parameters for the current process.<!-- END REF-->

If you pass the optional *\** parameter, this indicates that the *object* parameter is an object name (a string). If you do not pass this parameter, this indicates that the *object* is a variable or field. In this case, you pass a reference instead of a name.

In *languageCode*, you pass a string indicating the code of the language to use, based on RFC3066, ISO639 and ISO3166\. For more information, refer to the description of the [SET DATABASE LOCALIZATION](set-database-localization.md) command.
