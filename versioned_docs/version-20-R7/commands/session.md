#### Description

The `Session` command <!-- REF #_command_.Session.Summary -->returns the `Session` object corresponding to the current user session<!-- END REF -->.

Depending on the process from which the command is called, the current user session can be:

- a web session (when [scalable sessions are enabled](WebServer/sessions.md#enabling-sessions)),
- a remote client session,
- the stored procedures session.

For more information, see the [Session types](../command/session.md-types) paragraph.

If the command is called from a non supported context (single-user application, scalable sessions disabled...), it returns *Null*.

#### Web sessions

The `Session` object of web sessions is available from any web process:

- `On Web Authentication`, `On Web Connection`, and `On REST Authentication` database methods,
- code processed through 4D tags in semi-dynamic pages (4DTEXT, 4DHTML, 4DEVAL, 4DSCRIPT/, 4DCODE)
- project methods with the "Available through 4D tags and URLs (4DACTION...)" attribute and called through 4DACTION/ urls,
- [`On Mobile App Authentication`](https://developer.4d.com/go-mobile/docs/4d/on-mobile-app-authentication) and [`On Mobile App Action`](https://developer.4d.com/go-mobile/docs/4d/on-mobile-app-action) database methods for mobile requests,
- ORDA functions [called with REST requests](../REST/ClassFunctions.md).

For more information on web user sessions, please refer to the [Web Server Sessions](../WebServer/sessions.md) section.

#### Remote client sessions

The `Session` object of remote client sessions is available from:

- Project methods that have the [Execute on Server](../Project/code-overview.md#execute-on-server) attribute (they are executed in the "twinned" process of the client process),
- Triggers,
- `On Server Open Connection` and `On Server Shutdown Connection` database methods.

For more information on remote user sessions, please refer to the [**Remote client user sessions**](../Desktop/clientServer.md#remote-user-sessions) paragraph.

#### Stored procedures session

All stored procedure processes share the same virtual user session. The `Session` object of stored procedures is available from:

- methods called with the [`Execute on server`](../commands-legacy/execute-on-server.md) command,
- `On Server Startup`, `On Server Shutdown`, `On Backup Startup`, `On Backup Shutdown`, and `On System event` database methods

For information on stored procedures virtual user session, please refer to the [4D Server and the 4D Language](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv20R5/4D/20-R5/4D-Server-and-the-4D-Language.300-6932726.en.html) page.

#### Example

You have defined the `action_Session` method with attribute "Available through 4D tags and URLs". You call the method by entering the following URL in your browser:

```
IP:port/4DACTION/action_Session
```

```4d
  //action_Session method
 Case of
    :(Session#Null)
       If(Session.hasPrivilege("WebAdmin")) //calling the hasPrivilege function
          WEB SEND TEXT("4DACTION --> Session is WebAdmin")
       Else
          WEB SEND TEXT("4DACTION --> Session is not WebAdmin")
       End if
    Else
       WEB SEND TEXT("4DACTION --> Session is null")
 End case
```
