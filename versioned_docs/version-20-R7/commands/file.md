#### Description

The `File` command <!-- REF #_command_.File.Summary -->creates and returns a new object of the `4D.File` type<!-- END REF -->. The command accepts two syntaxes:

**File ( path { ; pathType } { ; * })**

In the *path* parameter, pass a file path string. You can use a custom string or a [filesystem](../Concepts/paths.md#filesystem-pathnames) (e.g., "/DATA/myfile.txt").

> Only absolute pathnames are supported with the `File` command.

By default, 4D expects a path expressed with the POSIX syntax. If you work with platform pathnames (Windows or macOS), you must declare it using the *pathType* parameter. The following constants are available:

|Constant|Value|Comment|
|---|---|---|
|fk platform path|1|Path expressed with a platform-specific syntax (mandatory in case of platform pathname)|
|fk posix path|0|Path expressed with POSIX syntax (default)

**File ( fileConstant { ; * } )**

In the *fileConstant* parameter, pass a 4D built-in or system file, using one of the following constants:

|Constant|Value|Comment|
|---|---|---|

If the target *fileConstant* does not exist, a null object is returned. No errors are raised.
