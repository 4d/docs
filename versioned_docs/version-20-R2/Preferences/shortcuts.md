This page lists all the shortcuts used in the 4D Design environment (except for standard "system" shortcuts, such as Ctrl+C/Command+C for the Copy command).

To modify a shortcut, you can select/deselect the item to modify (Shift, Alt or letter key) in the list. You can also double-click on a shortcut to configure it using a specific dialog box. 

Note that each shortcut implicitly includes the **Ctrl** (Windows) or **Command** (macOS) key.

If you edit this list, your custom shortcuts settings are stored in a *4DShortcutsvXX.xml* file, created at the same level as the [user preferences file](overview.md#storage). Hence, each time 4D is updated your keyboard shortcut preferences remain.
