Defines which image format to use for retrieving images (*e.g.*, `$imageformat=png`)

## Beschreibung

Define which format to use to display images. You can use one of the following formats (extensions, mime types and OsType Mac are supported):

| Typ                     | Beschreibung                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "best"                  | Best format based on the image |
| ".gif" or "image/gif"   | GIF format                     |
| ".png" or "image/png"   | PNG format                     |
| ".jpeg" or "image/jpeg" | JPEG format                    |
| ".tiff" or "image/tiff" | TIFF format                    |

Once you have defined the format, you must pass the image attribute to [`$expand`]($expand.md) to load the photo completely.

If there is no image to be loaded or the format doesn't allow the image to be loaded, the response will be an empty object `{}`.

## Beispiel

The following example defines the image format to JPEG regardless of the actual type of the photo and passes the actual version number sent by the server:

`GET  /rest/Employee(1)/photo?$imageformat=.jpeg&$version=3&$expand=photo`
