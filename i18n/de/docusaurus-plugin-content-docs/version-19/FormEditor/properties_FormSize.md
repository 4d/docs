title: Form Size
---

 
4D lets you set the size of both the form and the [window](properties_WindowSize.md). These properties are interdependent and your application interface results from their interaction.

Size options depend on the value of the **Size based on** option.

---

## Size based on

* **Automatic Size**: The size of the form will be that necessary to display all the objects, to which will be added the margin values (in pixels) entered in the [**Hor Margin**](#hor-margin) and [**Vert Margin**](#vert-margin) fields. You can choose this option when you want to use active objects placed in an offscreen area (*i.e.*, outside the bounding rectangle of the window) with an automatic size window. Thanks to this option, the presence of these objects will not modify the size of the window.

* **Set Size**: The size of the form will be based on what you enter (in pixels) in the [**Width**](#width) and [**Height**](#height) fields.

* `\&#060;object name&#062;`: The size of the form will be based on the position of the selected form object. For example, if you choose an object that is placed in the bottom-right part of the area to be displayed, the form size will consist of a rectangle whose upper left corner will be the origin of the form and the lower right corner will correspond to that of the selected object, plus any margin values.

> For output forms, only the [**Hor margin**](#hor-margin) or [**Width**](width) fields are available.

## Hor. Margin

Value to add (in pixels) to the right margin of the form when the [form size](#size-based-on) is **Automatic size** or `\&#060;object name&#062;`

This value also determines the right-hand margins of forms used in the Label editor.

## Vert. Margin

Value to add (in pixels) to the bottom margin of the form when the [form size](#size-based-on) is **Automatic size** or `\&#060;object name&#062;`.

This value also determines the top margins of forms used in the Label editor.
