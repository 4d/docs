| 32   | [List Box](../FormObjects/listbox_overview.md) - [List Box Column](../FormObjects/listbox_overview.md#list-box-columns) | A list box column is moved by the user via drag and drop |


## Beschreibung

This event is generated when a column of the list box is moved by the user using drag and drop ([if allowed](../FormObjects/properties_ListBox.md#locked-columns-and-static-columns)). It is not generated if the column is dragged and then dropped in its initial location.

The `LISTBOX MOVED COLUMN NUMBER` command returns the new position of the column.
