title: TLS Protocol (HTTPS)
---

All 4D servers can communicate in secured mode through the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol:

- the HTTP server
- the application server (client-server desktop applications)
- the SQL server

In addition, the 4D HTTP client (`HTTP get` command for example) also supports the TLS protocol.

## Überblick

The TLS protocol (successor of SSL) has been designed to secure data exchanges between two applications —mainly between a web server and a browser. This protocol is widely used and is compatible with most web browsers.

At the network level, the security protocol is inserted between the TCP/IP layer (low level) and the HTTP high level protocol. It has been designed mainly to work with HTTP.

The TLS protocol is designed to authenticate the sender and receiver and to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged information:

- **Authentication**: The sender and receiver identities are confirmed.
- **Confidentiality**: The sent data is encrypted so that no third person can understand the message.
- **Integrity**: The received data has not been changed, by accident or malevolently.

TLS uses a public key encryption technique based on a pair of asymmetric keys for encryption and decryption: a public key and a private key. The private key is used to encrypt data. The sender (the website) does not give it to anyone.

The public key is used to decrypt the information and is sent to the receivers (web browsers) through a **certificate**. The certificate is delivered through a Certification Authority. The website pays the certificate provider to deliver a certificate which guaranties the server authentication and contains the public key allowing to exchange data in a secured mode.

:::note

Web browsers authorize only the certificates issued by a Certification Authority referenced in their properties.

## Minimum version

By default, the minimum version of the secured protocol accepted by the 4D servers is TLS 1.3. You can modify this value by using the `Min TLS version` selector with the `SET DATABASE PARAMETER` command.

:::note

You can control separately the [minimum TLS version](WebServer/webServerConfig.md#minimum-tls-version) for **webServer objects**.

## Enabling TLS with the HTTP server

To be able to use the TLS protocol with the 4D HTTP server, you have to:

1. Get your certificate files.
2. Install your certificate files at the appropriate location(s)
3. Enable TLS.

### Certificates

#### Format angezeigt

TLS certificates managed by 4D must be in the **PEM format**. If your certificate provider sends you a certificate that is in a binary format such as .crt, .pfx or .p12, you have to convert it to PEM format in order to be able to use it. There are web sites where you can do this conversion on-line.

#### Encryption

4D supports certificates in the following standard encryption formats:

- [**RSA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
- [**ECDSA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)

:::info Compatibility

The ECDSA encryption format is not supported by the 4D [legacy network layer](../settings/client-server.md#network-layer).

:::

:::note

4D proposes two commands to help you requesting a RSA certificate, [see the tutorial below](#how-to-get-a-rsa-certificate-tutorial).

:::

### Installing certificate files

Certificate files include:

- **key.pem**: a document containing the private encryption key,
- **cert.pem**: a document containing the certificate.

Both **key.pem** and **cert.pem** files must be located:

- with 4D Server or 4D in local mode, next to the [project folder](Project/architecture.md#project-folder)
- with 4D in remote mode, in the client database folder on the remote machine (for more information about the location of this folder, see the [`Get 4D folder`](https://doc.4d.com/4dv20/help/command/en/page485.html) command). You must copy these files manually on the remote machine.

### Enabling TLS

For TLS connections to be accepted by the HTTP server, you must enable HTTPS. Refer to the [**Enable HTTPS**](WebServer/webServerConfig.md#enable-https) paragraph to know the different ways to enable TLS for the HTTP server.

:::note

The 4D web server also supports [HSTS option](WebServer/webServerConfig.md#enable-hsts) to declare that browsers should only interact with it via secure HTTPS connections.

### Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

[PFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy) adds an additional layer of security to your communications. Rather than using pre-established exchange keys, PFS creates session keys cooperatively between the communicating parties using Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithms. The joint manner in which the keys are constructed creates a "shared secret" which impedes outside parties from being able to compromise them.

When TLS is enabled on the server, PFS is automatically enabled. If the *dhparams.pem* file (document containing the server's DH private key) does not already exist, 4D will automatically generate it with a key size of 2048. The initial generation of this file could take several minutes. The file is placed with the [*key.pem* and *cert.pem* files](#installing-certificate-files).

If you use a [custom cipher list](WebServer/webServerConfig.md##cipher-list) and want to enable PFS, you must verify that it contains entries with DH or ECDH (Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman) algorithms.



## Enabling TLS with the other servers

To use TLS with the 4D application server (client-server desktop applications) or the SQL server, you only have to enable TLS communications and the server automatically configures the connections at startup.

- With the application server, select the **Encrypt Client-Server Communications** option in the ["Client-server/Network options" page of the Settings dialog box](../settings/client-server#encrypt-client-server-communications).
- With the SQL server, select the **Enable TLS** option in the ["SQL" page of the Settings dialog box](../settings/sql#sql-server-publishing).




## How to get a RSA certificate? (tutorial)

A server working in secured mode means that you need a digital certificate from a certification authority. This certificate contains various information such as the site ID as well as the public key used to communicate with the server. This certificate is transmitted to the clients (e.g. Web browsers) connecting to this server. Once the certificate has been identified and accepted, the communication is made in secured mode.
> Web browsers authorize only the certificates issued by a certification authority referenced in their properties.

The certification authority is chosen according to several criteria. If the certification authority is well known, the certificate will be authorized by many browsers, however the price to pay will be expensive.

To get a digital certificate:

1. Generate a private key using the `GENERATE ENCRYPTION KEYPAIR` command.
> **Warning**: For security reasons, the private key should always be kept secret. Actually, it should always remain with the server machine. For the Web server, the Key.pem file must be placed in the Project folder.

2. Use the `GENERATE CERTIFICATE REQUEST` command to issue a certificate request.

3. Send the certificate request to the chosen certificate authority. To fill in a certificate request, you might need to contact the certification authority. The certification authority checks that the information transmitted are correct. The certificate request is generated in a BLOB using the PKCS format encoded in base64 (PEM format). This principle allows you to copy and paste the keys as text and to send them via E-mail without modifying the key content. For example, you can save the BLOB containing the certificate request in a text document (using the `BLOB TO DOCUMENT` command), then open and copy and paste its content in a mail or a Web form to be sent to the certification authority.

4. Once you get your certificate, create a text file named “cert.pem” and paste the contents of the certificate into it. You can receive a certificate in different ways (usually by email or HTML form). 4D accepts all platform-related text formats for certificates (OS X, PC, Linux, etc.). However, the certificate must be in [PEM format](#format), *i.e.*, PKCS encoded in base64.
> CR line-ending characters are not supported on their own; you must use CRLF or LF.

5. Place the “cert.pem” file in the [appropriate location](#installing-certificate-files).

The 4D server can now work in a secured mode. A certificate is usually valid between 3 months to a year.
