The 4D [project architecture](../Project/architecture.md) is modular. You can provide additional functionalities to your 4D projects by installing [**components**](Concepts/components.md) and [**plug-ins**](../Concepts/plug-ins.md). Components are made of 4D code, while plug-ins can be built using any language.


## Preinstalled 4D components

4D includes by default a set of built-in 4D components, that you can see in the **Component Methods** theme of the Explorer's Methods page.


| Component Name                                                                | Beschreibung                                                                                                   | Main Features                                                                                            |

## Third-party components

You can develop and install your own 4D components. See [this page](develop-components.md) for more information.

Many developers from the 4D community have shared 4D components that you can install and use in you projects.

Browse Github to have a list of public 4D components gathered with the [`4d-component`](https://github.com/topics/4d-component) topic.


## Plugins

Plugins do things that 4D does not natively (e.g., specific platform technology), or would be very hard to write just using 4D. As described in [this page](develop-plug-ins.md), you can develop your own plug-ins. As described in [this page](develop-plug-ins.md), you can develop your own plug-ins.

A lot of functionnalities are covered by the existing 4D plug-ins. Browse Github to have a list of public 4D plugins gathered with the [`4d-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/4d-plugin) topic.
