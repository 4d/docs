title: Architecture of a project
---

A 4D project is made of several folders and files, stored within a single parent application folder (package folder). Beispiel:

- MyProject
  - `Komponenten`
  - `Data`
    - `Logs`
    - `Settings`
  - `Documentation`
  - `Plugins`
  - `Project`
    - `DerivedData`
    - `Sources`
    - `Trash`
  - `Resources`
  - `Settings`
  - `userPreferences.jSmith`
  - `WebFolder`

> If your project has been converted from a binary database, additional folders may be present. See "Converting databases to projects" on [doc.4d.com](https://doc.4d.com).

## Project folder

The Project folder typically contains the following hierarchy:

- `<applicationName>.4DProject` file
- `Sources`
  - `Klassen`
  - `DatabaseMethods`
  - `Methods`
  - `Forms`
  - `TableForms`
  - `Trigger`
- `DerivedData`
- `Trash` (if any)

### `<applicationName>.4DProject` file

Project development file, used to designate and launch the project. This file can be opened by:

- 4D
- 4D Server (read-only, see [Opening a remote project](Desktop/clientServer.md#opening-a-remote-project))

> In 4D projects, development is done with 4D and multi-user development is managed through source control tools. 4D Server can open .4DProject files for testing purposes.

This text file can also contain configuration keys, in particular [`"tokenizedText": false`](../Preferences/general.md#excluding-tokens-in-existing-projects).

**Note:** The .4dm file extension is a text-based file format, containing the code of a 4D method. It is compliant with source control tools.

### `Trash`

The Trash folder contains methods and forms that were deleted from the project (if any). It can contain the following folders:

- `Methods`
- `Forms`
- `TableForms`

Within these folders, deleted element names are in parentheses, e.g. "(myMethod).4dm". The folder organization is identical to the [Sources](#sources) folder.

### `DerivedData`

The DerivedData folder contains cached data used internally by 4D to optimize processing. It is automatically created or recreated when necessary. You can ignore this folder.

## `Libraries`

> This folder is used on macOS only.

The Librairies folder contains the file resulting from a compilation with the [Silicon compiler](compiler.md#silicon-compiler) on macOS.

## `Resources`

The Resources folder contains any custom project resource files and folders. In this folder, you can place all the files needed for the translation or customization of the application interface (picture files, text files, XLIFF files, etc.). 4D uses automatic mechanisms to work with the contents of this folder, in particular for the handling of XLIFF files and static pictures. For using in remote mode, the Resources folder lets you share files between the server machine and all the client machines. See the *4D Server Reference Manual*.

## `Data`

The data folder contains the data file and all files and folders relating to the data.

| data.4dd(*)  | Data file containing data entered in the records and all the data belonging to the records. When you open a 4D project, the application opens the current data file by default. If you change the name or location of this file, the *Open data file* dialog box will then appear so that you can select the data file to use or create a new one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | binary           |
| data.journal | Created only when the database uses a log file. The log file is used to ensure the security of the data between backups. All operations carried out on the data are recorded sequentially in this file. Therefore, each operation on the data causes two simultaneous actions: the first on the data (the statement is executed normally) and the second in the log file (a description of the operation is recorded). The log file is constructed independently, without disturbing or slowing down the user’s work. A database can only work with a single log file at a time. The log file records operations such as additions, modifications or deletions of records, transactions, etc. It is generated by default when a database is created.

(*) When the project is created from a .4db binary database, the data file is left untouched. Thus, it can be named differently and placed in another location.

### `Settings`

This folder contains **user settings files for data** used for application administration.

> These settings take priority over **[user settings files](#settings-1)** and **[structure settings](#sources)** files.
