## Beschreibung

This event is generated when the opening of a pop-up window is blocked by the Web area. 4D Web areas do not allow the opening of pop-up windows.

You can find out the blocked URL using the `WA Get last filtered URL` command.

This event is also triggered when a drop operation has been done in the Web area (with embedded and Wwindows system [engines](../FormObjects/properties_WebArea.md#use-embedded-web-rendering-engine)) if the [Drag and drop](../FormObjects/webArea_overview.md#user-interface) option is also enabled for the area. You can accept the drop by calling:

```4d
//web area object method
If (FORM Event.code=On Window Opening Denied)
 WA OPEN URL(*; "WebArea"; WA Get last filtered URL(*; "WebArea"))  
 // or UrlVariable:=WA Get last filtered URL(*; "WebArea")  
 // where UrlVariable is the URL variable associated to the web area
End if 
```
