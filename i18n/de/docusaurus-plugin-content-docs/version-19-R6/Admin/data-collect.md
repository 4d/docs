---

To help us make our products always better, we automatically collect data regarding usage statistics on running 4D Server applications. Collected data is completely anonymous and data is transferred with no impact on the user experience.

This page explains:

- what information is collected
- where information is stored and when it is sent to 4D
- how to disable automatic data collection in client/server built applications.


## Collected information

Data is collected during the following events:

- 4D Server startup,
- database opening,
- database closure,
- web server startup.

## When is it stored and sent?

Collected data is written in a text file (JSON format) when 4D Server quits. The file is stored inside the [active 4D folder](https://doc.4d.com/4dv19/help/command/en/page485.html), i.e.:

- on Windows: `Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\4D Server`
- on macOS: `/Users/[userName]/Library/ApplicationSupport/4D Server`

Once a week, the file is automatically sent over the network to 4D. The file is then deleted from the active 4D folder.

> If the file could not be sent for some reason, it is nevertheless deleted and no error message is displayed on the 4D Server side.


## Disabling data collection in client/server built applications

You can disable the automatic data collection in [client/server built applications](../Desktop/building.md#clientserver-page).

To disable the collection, pass the value **False** to the [`ServerDataCollection`](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv19R6/4D/19-R6/ServerDataCollection.300-6011712.en.html) key in the `buildApp.4DSettings` file, used to build the client/server application.
