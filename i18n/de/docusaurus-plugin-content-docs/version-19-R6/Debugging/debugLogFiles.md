title: Description of log files
---

4D applications can generate several log files that are useful for debugging or optimizing their execution. Logs are usually started or stopped using selectors of the [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](https://doc.4d.com/4dv19/help/command/en/page642.html) or [WEB SET OPTION](https://doc.4d.com/4dv19/help/command/en/page1210.html) commands and are stored in the [Logs folder](Project/architecture.md#logs) of the project.

Information logged needs to be analyzed to detect and fix issues. This section provides a comprehensive description of the following log files:

* [4DRequestsLog.txt](#4drequestslogtxt)
* [4DRequestsLog_ProcessInfo.txt](l#4drequestslog_processinfotxt)
* [HTTPDebugLog.txt](#httpdebuglogtxt)
* 4DDebugLog.txt ([standard](#4ddebuglogtxt-standard) & [tabular](#4ddebuglogtxt-tabular))
* [4DDiagnosticLog.txt](#4ddiagnosticlogtxt)
* [4DIMAPLog.txt](#4dsmtplogtxt-4dpop3logtxt-and-4dimaplogtxt)
* [4DPOP3Log.txt](#4dsmtplogtxt-4dpop3logtxt-and-4dimaplogtxt)
* [4DSMTPLog.txt](#4dsmtplogtxt-4dpop3logtxt-and-4dimaplogtxt)
* [ORDA client requests log file](#orda-client-requests)

> When a log file can be generated either on 4D Server or on the remote client, the word "Server" is added to the server-side log file name, for example "4DRequestsLogServer.txt"

Log files share some fields so that you can establish a chronology and make connections between entries while debugging:

* `sequence_number`: this number is unique over all debug logs and is incremented for each new entry whatever the log file, so that you can know the exact sequence of the operations.
* `connection_uuid`: for any 4D process created on a 4D client that connects to a server, this connection UUID is logged on both server and client side. It allows you to easily identify the remote client that launched each process.

## 4DRequestsLog.txt

This log file records standard requests carried out by the 4D Server machine or the 4D remote machine that executed the command (excluding Web requests).

How to start this log:

* on the server:

```4d
SET DATABASE PARAMETER(4D Server log recording;1)
//server side
```

* on a client:

```4d
SET DATABASE PARAMETER(Client Log Recording;1)
//remote side
```
> This statement also starts the [4DRequestsLog_ProcessInfo.txt](l#4drequestslog_processinfotxt) log file.

#### Headers

This file starts with the following headers:

* Log Session Identifier
* Hostname of the server that hosts the application
* User Login Name: login on the OS of the user that ran the 4D application on the server.

#### Inhalt

For each request, the following fields are logged:

## 4DDiagnosticLog.txt

This log file records many events related to the internal application operation and is human-readable. You can include custom information in this file using the [LOG EVENT](https://doc.4d.com/4dv19/help/command/en/page667.html) command.

How to start this log:

```4d
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(Diagnostic log recording;1) //start recording
```

The following fields are logged for each event:

| Field Name         | Beschreibung                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sequenceNumber     | Unique and sequential operation number in the logging session |
| timestamp          | Date and time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.mmm)    |
| loggerID           | Optional                                                      |
| componentSignature | Optional - internal component signature                       |
| messageLevel       | Info, Warning, Error                                          |
| message            | Description of the log entry                                  |

Depending on the event, various other fields can also be logged, such as task, socket, etc.

### Diagnostic log levels

The *4DDiagnosticLog.txt* file can log different levels of messages, from `ERROR` (most important) to `TRACE` (less important). By default, the `INFO` level is set, which means that the file will log only important events, including errors and unexpected results (see below).

You can select the level of messages using the `Diagnostic log level` selector of the [SET DATABASE PARAMETER](https://doc.4d.com/4dv19/help/command/en/page642.html) command, depending on your needs. When you select a level, levels above (which are more important) are implicitely selected also. The following levels are available:

| Message level | Beschreibung                                                                                  | When selected, includes         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ERROR         | A part of the application does not work                                                       | ERROR                           |
| WARN          | Potential error, use of a deprecated function, poor uses, undesirable or unexpected situation | ERROR, WARN                     |
| INFO          | *Default level* - Important application event                                                 | ERROR, WARN, INFO               |
| DEBUG         | Detail of application flow (for 4D technical services)                                        | ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG        |
| TRACE         | Other internal information (for 4D technical services)                                        | ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE |

## 4DSMTPLog.txt, 4DPOP3Log.txt, and 4DIMAPLog.txt

These log files record each exchange between the 4D application and the mail server (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) that has been initiated by the following commands:

* SMTP - [SMTP New transporter](API/SMTPTransporterClass.md#smtp-new-transporter)
* POP3 - [POP3 New transporter](API/POP3TransporterClass.md#pop3-new-transporter)
* IMAP  - [IMAP New transporter](API/IMAPTransporterClass.md#imap-new-transporter)

The log files can be produced in two versions:

* a regular version:
  * named 4DSMTPLog.txt, 4DPOP3Log.txt, or 4DIMAPLog.txt
  * no attachments
  * uses an automatic circular file recycling each 10 MB
  * intended for usual debugging

 To start this log:

 ```4d
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(SMTP Log;1) //start SMTP log
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(POP3 Log;1) //start POP3 log
 SET DATABASE PARAMETER(IMAP Log;1) //start IMAP log
 ```

> 4D Server: Click on the **Start Request and Debug Logs** button in the [Maintenance Page](ServerWindow/maintenance.md) of the 4D Server administration window.

   This log path is returned by the `Get 4D file` command.

* an extended version:
  * attachment(s) included no automatic recycling
  * custom name
  * reserved for specific purposes

 To start this log:

 ```4d
 $server:=New object
 ...
 $server:=New object
 ...
 //SMTP
 $server.logFile:="MySMTPAuthLog.txt"
 $transporter:=SMTP New transporter($server)

 // POP3
 $server.logFile:="MyPOP3AuthLog.txt"
 $transporter:=POP3 New transporter($server)

 //IMAP
 $server.logFile:="MyIMAPAuthLog.txt"
 $transporter:=IMAP New transporter($server)
 ```

## ORDA client requests

This log records each ORDA request sent from a remote machine. You can direct log information to memory or to a file on disk. The name and location of this log file are your choice.

How to start this log:

```4d
//to be executed on a remote machine
ds.startRequestLog(File("/PACKAGE/Logs/ordaLog.txt"))  
//can be also sent to memory
```

If you want to use the unique sequence number in ORDA request log, you need to trigger it:

```4d
//to be executed on a remote machine

SET DATABASE PARAMETER(Client Log Recording;1)  
//to enable log sequence number

ds.startRequestLog(File("/PACKAGE/Logs/ordaLog.txt"))  
//can be also sent to memory

SET DATABASE PARAMETER(Client Log Recording;0)  
//disabling sequence number
```

The following fields are logged for each request:

## Using a log configuration file

You can use a **log configuration file** to easily manage log recording in a production environment. This file is preconfigured by the developer. Typically, it can be sent to customers so that they just need to select it or copy it in a local folder. Once enabled, the log configuration file triggers the recording of specific logs.

### How to enable the file

There are several ways to enable the log configuration file:

* On 4D Server with interface, you can open the Maintenance page and click on the [Load logs configuration file](ServerWindow/maintenance.md#load-logs-configuration-file) button, then select the file. In this case, you can use any name for the configuration file. It is immediately enabled on the server.
* You can copy the log configuration file in the [Settings folder](Project/architecture.md#settings-1) of the project. In this case, the file must be named `logConfig.json`. It is enabled at project startup (only on the server in client/server).
* With a built application, you can copy the `logConfig.json` file in the following folder:
  * Windows: `Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\[application]`
  * macOS: `/Users/[userName]/Library/ApplicationSupport/[application]`

> If you want to enable the log configuration file for all projects in stand-alone, server and remote 4D applications, you can copy the `logConfig.json` file in the following folder:
> 
> * Windows: `Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\4D or \4D Server`
> * macOS: `/Users/[userName]/Library/ApplicationSupport/4D or /4D Server`

### JSON file description

The log configuration file is a `.json` file that can contain the following properties:
