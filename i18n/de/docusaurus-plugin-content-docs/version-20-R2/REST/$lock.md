Locks and unlocks an entity using the [pessimistic mechanism](../ORDA/entities.md#pessimistic-lock).


## Syntax

To lock an entity for other sessions and 4D processes:

```
/?$lock=true
```


To unlock the entity for other sessions and 4D processes:

```
/?$lock=false
```


The [`lockKindText` property](../API/EntityClass.md#lock) is "Locked by session".


### Beschreibung

The locks triggered by the REST API are put at the [session](authUsers.md#opening-sessions) level.

A locked entity is seen as *locked* (i.e. lock / unlock / update / delete actions are not possible) by:

- other REST sessions
- 4D processes (client/server, remote datastore, standalone) running on the REST server.

An entity locked by the REST API can only be unlocked:

- by its locker, i.e. a `/?$lock=false` in the REST session that sets `/?$lock=true`
- or if the session's [inactivity timeout]($directory.md) is reached (the session is closed).

### Response

A `?$lock` request returns a JSON object with `"result"=true` if the lock operation was successful and `"result"=false` if it failed.

The returned "__STATUS" object has the following properties:

## Beispiel


We lock an entity in a first browser:

```
GET /rest/Customers(1)/?$lock=true
```

**Response:**

```
{
    "result": true,
    "__STATUS": {
        "success": true
    }
}
```

In a second browser (other session), we send the same request.

**Response:**

```
{
    "result":false,
    "__STATUS":{
        "status":3,
        "statusText":"Already Locked",
        "lockKind":7,
        "lockKindText":"Locked By Session",
        "lockInfo":{
            "host":"127.0.0.1:8043",
            "IPAddr":"127.0.0.1",
            "recordNumber": 7,
            "userAgent": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_3) AppleWebKit/537.36..."
        }
    }
}
```
