title: Operators
---

An operator is a symbol or a group of symbols that you use to check, modify, or combine values. You are already familiar with many operators. For example, `1 + 2` uses the addition (or plus sign) operator to add two numbers together, and the result is 3. Comparison operators, like = or >, let you compare two or more values.

The 4D language supports the operators you may already know from other languages like C or JavaScript. However, the assignment operator is `:=` to prevent it from being mistakenly used when the equal to operator (`=`) is intended. [Basic operators](#basic-operators) such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %...) and comparison operators (=, >, >=...) can be used with numbers, but also with boolean, text, date, time, pointer, or picture data types. Like JavaScript, the 4D language supports the concept of [truthy and falsy values](#truthy-and-falsy), which in use in [short-cicrcuit operators](#short-circuit-operators).


## Terminology

The 4D language supports **binary** and **ternary** operators:

- binary operators operate on two targets (such as `2 + 3`) and appear in between their two targets.
- ternary operators operate on three targets. Like C, 4D has only one ternary operator, the [ternary conditional operator](#ternary-operator) (`a ? b : c`).

The values that operators affect are operands. In the expression `1 + 2`, the + symbol is a binary operator and its two operands are the values 1 and 2.



## Assignment operator

The **assignment operator** (`a:=b`) initializes or updates the value of `a` with the value of `b`:

```4d
$myNumber:=3 //assigns 3 to MyNumber variable  
$myDate:=!2018/01/21! //assigns a date literal
$myLength:=Length("Acme") //assigns the result of the command (4) to $myLength
$col:=New collection //$col is initialized with an empty collection
```

> Do NOT confuse the assignment operator `:=` with the equality comparison operator `=`. A different assignment operator (and not `=`) was deliberately chosen to avoid issues and confusion which often occur with == or === in other programming languages. Such errors are often difficult to recognize by the compiler and lead to time-consuming troubleshooting.


## Basic operators

Operator results depend on the **data types** they are applied to. 4D supports different operators on scalar data types. They are described with the data types, in the following sections:

- [**Logical operators**](dt_boolean.md#logical-operators) (on **boolean** expressions)
- [**Date operators**](dt_date.md#date-operators)
- [**Time operators**](dt_time.md#time-operators)
- [**Number operators**](dt_number.md#number-operators)
- [**Bitwise operators**](dt_number.md#bitwise-operators) (on **long integer** expressions)
- [**Picture operators**](dt_picture.md#picture-operators)
- [**Pointer operators**](dt_pointer.md#pointer-operators)
- [**String operators**](dt_string.md#string-operators)


## Compound assignment operators

4D provides **compound assignment operators** that combine assignment with another operation. One example is the addition assignment operator (`+=`):

```4d
$a:=1 
$a+=2 // $a=3
```


The following compound assignment operators are supported:

| Operator       | Syntax             | Assigns | Example                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Addition       | Text += Text       | Text    | `$t+=" World"  //$t:=$t+" World"`                                   |
|                | Number += Number   | Number  | `$n+=5 //$n:=$n+5`                                                  |
|                | Date += Number     | Date    | `$d+=5 //$d:=$d+5`                                                  |

|                | Time += Number     | Number  | `$t1+=5 //$t1:=$t1+5`                                               |
|                | Picture += Picture | Picture | `$p1+=$p2 //$p1:=$p1+$p2 (add $p2 to the right of $p1)`             |
|                | Picture += Number  | Picture | `$p1+=5 //$p1:=$p1+5 (move $p1 horizontally 5 pixels to the right)` |
| Subtraction    | Number -= Number   | Number  | `$n-=5 //$n:=$n-5`                                                  |
|                | Date -= Number     | Date    | `$d-=5 //$d:=$d-5`                                                  |
|                | Time -= Time       | Time    | `$t1-=$t2 //$t1:=$t1-$t2`                                           |
|                | Time -= Number     | Number  | `$t1-=5 //$t1:=$t1-5`                                               |
|                | Picture -= Number  | Picture | `$p1-=5 //$p1:=$p1-5 (move $p1 horizontally 5 pixels to the left)`  |
| Division       | Number /= Number   | Number  | `$n/=5 //$n:=$n/5`                                                  |
|                | Time /= Time       | Time    | `$t1/=$t2 //$t1:=$t1/$t2`                                           |
|                | Time /= Number     | Number  | `$t1/=5 //$t1:=$t1/5`                                               |
|                | Picture /= Picture | Picture | `$p1/=$p2 //$p1:=$p1/$p2 (add $p2 to the bottom of $p1)`            |
|                | Picture /= Number  | Picture | `$p1/=5 //$p1:=$p1/5 (move $p1 vertically 5 pixels)`                |
| Multiplication | Text *= Number     | Text    | `$t*="abc"  //$t:=$t*"abc"`                                         |

|                | Time *= Time       | Time    | `$t1*=$t2 //$t1:=$t1*$t2`                                           |
|                | Time *= Number     | Number  | `$t1*=5 //$t1:=$t1*5`                                               |
|                | Picture *= Number  | Picture | `$p1*=5 //$p1:=$p1*5 (resize $p1 by 5)`                             |

These operators apply on any [assignable expressions](quick-tour.md#assignable-vs-non-assignable-expressions) (except pictures as object properties or collection elements).

The operation "source `operator` value" is not strictly equivalent to "source := source `operator` value" because the expression designating the source (variable, field, object property, collection element) is only evaluated once. For example, in such expression as `getPointer()->+=1` the `getPointer` method is called only once.

> [Character indexing in text](dt_string.md#character-reference-symbols) and [byte indexing in blob](dt_blob.md#accessing-a-scalar-blobs-bytes) do not support these operators.
#### Examples

```4d
// Addition
$x:=2
$x+=5 //$x=7

$t:="Hello" 
$t+=" World" //$t="Hello World" 

$d:=!2000-11-10!
$d+=10 //$d=!2000-11-20!

// Subtraction
$x1:=10
$x1-=5 //$x1=5

$d1:=!2000-11-10!
$d1-=10 // $d1=!2000-10-31!

// Division
$x3:=10
$x3/=2 // $x3=5


// Multiplication
$x2:=10
$x2*=5 // $x2=10

$t2:="Hello" 
$t2*=2 // $t2="HelloHello"

```




## Short-circuit operators

The **&&** and **||** operators are **short circuit operators**. A short circuit operator is one that doesn't necessarily evaluate all of its operands.

The difference with the single [**&** and **|** boolean operators](dt_boolean.md#logical-operators) is that the short-circuit operators **&&** and **||** don't return a boolean value. They evaluate expressions as [truthy or falsy](#truthy-and-falsy), then return one of the expressions.

### Short-circuit AND operator (&&)

The rule is as follows:

Given `Expr1 && Expr2`:

The short-circuit AND operator evaluates operands from left to right, returning immediately with the value of the first falsy operand it encounters; if all values are [truthy](#truthy-and-falsy), the value of the last operand is returned.

The following table summarizes the different cases for the **&&** operator:

| Expr1  | Expr2  | Value returned |
| ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| truthy | truthy | Expr2          |
| truthy | falsy  | Expr2          |
| falsy  | truthy | Expr1          |
| falsy  | falsy  | Expr1          |

#### Example 1

```4d
var $v : Variant

$v:= "Hello" && "World" //"World"
$v:=False && 0 // False
$v:=0 && False // False
$v:=5 && !00-00-00! // 00/00/00
$v := 5 && 10 && "hello" //"hello"
```

#### Example 2

Say you have an online store, and some products have a tax rate applied, and others don't.

To calculate the tax, you multiply the price by the tax rate, which may not have been specified.

So you can write this:

```4d
var $tax : Variant

$tax:=$item.taxRate && ($item.price*$item.taxRate)
```

`$tax` will be NULL if taxRate is NULL (or undefined), otherwise it will store the result of the calculation.

#### Example 3

Short-circuit operators are useful in tests such as:

```4d
If(($myObject#Null) && ($myObject.value>10))
    //code
End if
```

If $myObject is Null, the second argument is not executed, thus no error is thrown.

### Short-circuit OR operator (||)

The || operator returns the value of one of the specified operands. The expression is evaluated left to right and tested for possible "short-circuit" evaluation using the following rule:

Given `Expr1 || Expr2`:

If Expr1 is [truthy](#truthy-and-falsy), Expr2 is not evaluated and the calculation returns Expr1.

If Expr1 is [falsy](#truthy-and-falsy), the calculation returns Expr2.

The following table summarizes the different cases and the value returned for the **||** operator:

| Expr1  | Expr2  | Value returned |
| ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| truthy | truthy | Expr1          |
| truthy | falsy  | Expr1          |
| falsy  | truthy | Expr2          |
| falsy  | falsy  | Expr2          |

#### Example 1

Say you have a table called Employee. Some employees have entered a phone number, and others haven't. This means that `$emp.phone` could be NULL, and you cannot assign NULL to a Text variable. But you can write the following:

```4d
var $phone : Text

$phone:=$emp.phone || "n/a"
```

In which case `$phone` will store either a phone number or the "n/a" string.

#### Example 2

Given a table called Person with a *name* field, as well as a *maiden name* field for married women.

The following example checks if there is a maiden name and stores it in a variable, otherwise it simply stores the person's name:

```4d
var $name: Text

$name:=$person.maidenName || $person.name
```

### Precedence

The `&&` and `||` operators have the same precedence as the logical operators `&` and `|`, and are evaluated left to right.

This means that `a || b && c` is evaluated as `(a || b) && c`.


## Ternary operator

The ternary conditional operator allows you to write one-line conditional expressions. For example, it can replace a full sequence of [If…Else](./cf_branching.md#ifelseend-if) statements.

It takes three operands in the following order:

* a condition followed by a question mark (?)
* an expression to execute if the condition is [truthy](#truthy-and-falsy), followed by a colon (:)
* an expression to execute if the condition is [falsy](#truthy-and-falsy)

### Syntax

The syntax is as follows:

`condition ? exprIfTruthy : exprIfFalsy`

> Since the [token syntax](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv19R3/4D/19-R3/Using-tokens-in-formulas.300-5583062.en.html) uses colons, we recommend inserting a space after the colon `:` or enclosing tokens using parentheses to avoid any conflicts.

### Examples

#### A simple example

```4d
var $age : Integer
var $beverage : Text

$age:=26
$beverage:=($age>=21) ? "Beer" : "Juice"

ALERT($beverage) // "Beer"
```

#### Handling data from a table

This example stores a person's full name in a variable, and handles the case when no first name or last name has been specified:

```4d
var $fullname : Text

// If one of the names is missing, store the one that exists, otherwise store an empty string
$fullname:=($person.firstname && $person.lastname) ? ($person.firstname+" "+$person.lastname) : ($person.lastname || $person.firstname) || ""
```

## Truthy and falsy

As well as a type, each value also has an inherent Boolean value, generally known as either **truthy** or **falsy**.

> **truthy** and **falsy** values are only evaluated by [short-circuit](#short-circuit-operators) and [ternary](#ternary-operator) operators.

The following values are **falsy**:

* false
* Null
* undefined
* Null object
* Null collection
* Null pointer
* Null picture
* Null date !00-00-00!
* "" - Empty strings
* [] - Empty collections
* {} - Empty objects

All other values are considered **truthy**, including:

* 0 - numeric zero (Integer or otherwise)

In 4D, **truthy** and **falsy** evaluation reflects the **usability** of a value, which means that a truthy value exists and can be processed by the code without generating errors or unexpected results. The rationale behind this is to provide a convenient way to handle *undefined* and *null* values in objects and collections, so that a reduced number of [If…Else](./cf_branching.md#ifelseend-if) statements are necessary to avoid runtime errors.

For example, when you use a [short-circuit OR operator](#short-circuit-or-operator-):

```4d
$value:=$object.value || $defaultValue
```

... you get the default value whenever *$object* does not contain the `value` property OR when it is *null*. So this operator checks the existence or usability of the value instead of a specific value. Note that because the numerical value 0 exists and is usable, it is not treated specially, thus it is **truthy**.

Regarding values representing collections, objects, or strings, "empty" values are considered **falsy**. It is handy when you want to assign a default value whenever an empty one is encountered.

```4d
$phone:=$emp.phone || "n/a"
```
