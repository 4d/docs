:::caution Developer Preview

Qodly Studio in 4D is currently in the **Developer Preview** phase. It should not be used in production.

:::

**Qodly Studio** is an application interface builder. It provides developers with integrated tools, including a form editor, a code editor, a rendering engine, and supports natively the [ORDA technology](../ORDA/overview.md).

You can use Qodly Studio directly from your **4D environment** to build modern and sophisticated interfaces that you can easily integrate to your existing 4D projects and deploy **on premise**.

Qodly Studio can also be used in the [**Qodly Cloud platform**](qodly.com), dedicated to the development of web business applications.

With Qodly Studio, you will discover a totally new web UI, get familiar with the concept of datasources, and learn how to:

- create webforms by placing components on a page
- map components to data
- trigger 4D code by configuring events
- and much more.

:::info

The use of Qodly Studio in 4D requires a 4D partner license. Qodly Studio options and menu items won't appear if the license is not activated.

:::

## Configuration

### Conditions requises

#### Browser

Qodly Studio supports the following web browsers:

- Chrome
- Edge
- FireFox

The recommended resolution is 1920x1080.

#### 4D application

- Development: 4D v20 R2 or higher
- Deployment: 4D Server v20 R2 or higher
- Qodly Studio only works with 4D projects (binary databases are not supported).


### Enabling access to Qodly Studio

By default, access to Qodly Studio is not granted.

Qodly Studio is served by the [WebAdmin web server](../Admin/webAdmin.md) and displays data from 4D projects handled by the [4D web server](webServer.md).

To enable access to Qodly Studio, you must explicitly allow it at two levels:

* at 4D level (4D or 4D Server)
* at project level

If one of the two levels (or both) are not enabled, access to Qodly Studio is denied (a 403 page is returned).

#### At 4D level

As a first security level, you need to [allow access to Qodly Studio on the WebAdmin web server](../Admin/webAdmin.md#enable-access-to-qodly-studio).

This setting applies to the 4D application (4D or 4D Server) on the host machine. All projects opened with that 4D application take this setting into account.

Keep this option unchecked if you want to make sure no access to Qodly Studio is allowed on the application.

Check this option to make it possible to access Qodly Studio. However, you still need to enable it at every project level.

Additionally, you can [configure the WebAdmin web server's HTTP/HTTPS port used](../Admin/webAdmin.md#accept-http-connections-on-localhost).

:::note

After any change to these settings, you must [restart the WebAdmin web server](../Admin/webAdmin.md#start-and-stop) for the new configuration to be effective.

:::

#### At project level

After you have enabled access to Qodly Studio at the 4D level, you need to explicitly designate every project that can be accessed. The **Enable access to Qodly Studio** option must be enabled on the [Web Features page of the 4D application's Settings](../settings/web.md#enable-access-to-qodly-studio).

Keep in mind that [user settings](../settings/overview.md) can be defined at several levels, and that priorities apply.


### Activating authentication

Authentication on the WebAdmin web server is granted using an access key. For more details, see [Access key](../Admin/webAdmin.md#access-key).

### Enabling rendering

To enable the rendering of webforms that are created in Qodly Studio, the following options must be set.

* The 4D project's **Settings** > **Web** > **Web Features** > [**Expose as REST server**](../settings/web.md#exposed-as-rest-server) option must be activated
* The [4D web server](webServer.md) must be running

When rendering webforms in the Web Studio, the renderer will connect to the 4D web server through HTTP or HTTPS, depending on the settings, following the same HTTP/HTTPS connection pattern as for the [WebAdmin web server](../Admin/webAdmin.md#accept-http-connections-on-localhost).

:::info

See [this page](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/studio/rendering) for information on how to render webforms in Qodly.

:::

Note that when you click on the "Preview in a new tab" button, a tab will open at `IP:port/$lib/renderer/?w=WebFormName` on your machine.

Keep in mind that the Qodly Web Studio runs through the 4D WebAdmin web server. When you use Qodly Web Studio as a developer, even when you preview a webform in the studio, you're using the 4D WebAdmin web server. This allows you to see dataclasses, functions and attributes that are not exposed as REST resources for example (they are greyed out).

However, webform rendering happens outside 4D Web Studio, and is served by the standard 4D web server. In this situation, your web application cannot access assets that are not exposed as REST resources. See [Exposed vs non-exposed functions](../ORDA/ordaClasses.md#exposed-vs-non-exposed-functions) and [Exposing tables](../REST/configuration.md#exposing-tables) for more information on how to expose assets.

:::note

[Renderer buttons](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/studio/rendering#how-to-render-a-webform) are hidden if the configuration options are not activated.

:::

### WebAdmin server and deployment

For deployment, the WebAdmin server is not necessary. End-user access to your web application made with Qodly Studio is based on the 4D REST protocol, and as such, it works as through a conventional 4D remote application.


### Using project methods

We recommend using class functions over project methods. Only class functions can be called from components. However, you can still use your project methods in Qodly Studio in two ways:

- You can call your methods from class functions.
- You can directly [execute your methods](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/studio/coding#methods-and-classes) from the Qodly Explorer.

## Opening Qodly Studio

The Qodly Studio page is available when the [WebAdmin web server is running](../Admin/webAdmin.md#start-and-stop) and authentication is activated (see above).

There are two ways to access Qodly Studio:

* from your 4D single-user application, go to **Design** > **Qodly Studio...**. If the WebAdmin web server is already running, depending on its configuration, your default browser opens at `IPaddress:HTTPPort/studio` or `IPaddress:HTTPSPort/studio`. Otherwise, you will be prompted if you want to start the WebAdmin web server first.

* on a browser, with the WebAdmin web server running (launched from 4D or 4D Server), enter the following address:

`IPaddress:HTTPPort/studio`

ou :

`IPaddress:HTTPSPort/studio`

For example, after launching a local web server on port 7080, type this address in your browser:

`localhost:7080/studio`

You will then be prompted to enter the [access key](../Admin/webAdmin.md#access-key) to access Qodly Studio.


## Using Qodly Studio

The official Qodly Studio documentation is available on the [Qodly documentation website](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/studio/overview).

You can rely on this documentation and its associated resources for developing web applications powered by webforms. However, depending on implementation stage, 4D developers will either use Qodly Studio or 4D IDE.

:::info

There is no direct compatibility between apps implemented with 4D and apps implemented with Qodly.

(1) If you click on the **Model** button in Qodly Studio, nothing happens. (2) When you open some 4D code in Qodly Studio, syntax coloring is not available and a "Lsp not loaded" warning is displayed.


### Project management

In accordance with the management of 4D projects, only the following usages are supported:

- development with Qodly Studio must be done using **4D** (single-user).
- deployment of 4D applications powered with Qodly webforms must be done using **4D Server**.



### From QodlyScript to 4D Language

4D developers can use the [Qodly Studio documentation](developer.qodly.com/docs/studio) to learn how to design their webforms in Qodly Studio. Code examples are provided in QodlyScript, but since QodlyScript inherits from the 4D Language, you won't be lost. Converting QodlyScript code to 4D language is easy, it only requires some adaptations:

#### Variable names

QodlyScript only support local variables, so variables in QodlyScript examples are not prefixed with `$`. In the 4D code, make sure to **prefix variable names with `$`** so that they are identifed as local variables by 4D.

#### Symbols and keywords

Some basic symbols, operators, and keywords differ in QodlyScript and must be adapted to the 4D Language. They are listed below:

| QodlyScript | 4D Language                                                 | Commentaire         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ,           | ;                                                           | argument separator  |
| =           | :=                                                          | assignment operator |
| ==          | =                                                           | comparison operator |
| declare     | #Declare                                                    |                     |
| switch      | Case of                                                     |                     |
| constructor | Class constructor                                           |                     |
| extends     | Class extends                                               |                     |
| end         | End for, End For each, End if, End case, End use, End while |                     |
| forEach     | For each                                                    |                     |
| string      | Text                                                        | var type            |
| number      | Real                                                        | var type            |

Some other items have a different case (ex: `this` vs `This`) but can be pasted directly in 4D code.


#### Command names

QodlyScript command names are written in camel case without spaces. You might need to adapt these commands to the 4D Language.

- Usually, you will only have to simply convert names. For example, `newCollection` in QodlyScript is `New collection` in 4D Language.
- However, some command have been renamed for a better compliance. They are listed below:

| QodlyScript            | 4D Language      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| `atan`                 | `Arctan`         |
| `highestProcessNumber` | `Count tasks`    |
| `callChain`            | `Get call chain` |
| `objectClass`          | `OB Class`       |
| `objectCopy`           | `OB Copy`        |
| `objectEntries`        | `OB Entries`     |
| `instanceOf`           | `OB Instance of` |
| `objectIsDefined`      | `OB Is defined`  |
| `objectIsEmpty`        | `OB Is empty`    |
| `objectIsShared`       | `OB Is shared`   |
| `objectKeys`           | `OB Keys`        |
| `objectRemove`         | `OB REMOVE`      |
| `objectValues`         | `OB Values`      |
| `sqrt`                 | `Square root`    |


#### Exemple

- QodlyScript code:

```qs
 declare(entitySelection : 4D.EntitySelection)  
 var dataClass : 4D.DataClass
 var entity, duplicate : 4D.Entity
 var status : object
 dataClass=entitySelection.getDataClass()
 forEach(entity,entitySelection)
    duplicate=dataClass.new()
    duplicate.fromObject(entity.toObject())
    duplicate[dataClass.getInfo().primaryKey]=null
    status=duplicate.save()
 end
```



- 4D Language equivalent code:

```4d
 #DECLARE ( $entitySelection : 4D.EntitySelection )  
 var $dataClass : 4D.DataClass
 var $entity; $duplicate : 4D.Entity
 var $status : Object
 $dataClass:=$entitySelection.getDataClass()
 For each($entity;$entitySelection)
    $duplicate:=$dataClass.new()
    $duplicate.fromObject($entity.toObject())
    $duplicate[$dataClass.getInfo().primaryKey]:=Null
    $status:=$duplicate.save()
 End for each

```

### Offline use

You can develop with Qodly Studio while your computer is not connected to the internet. In this case however, the following features are not available:

- [Templates](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/studio/design-webforms/templates): the Template library is empty
- UI tips: they are not displayed when you click on ![alt-text](../assets/en/WebServer/tips.png) icons.


## About license usage

To render webforms, you must have an available license, as rendering a webform opens a session on the project database's main web server.

### URL Schemes

Qodly Studio's URL scheme configuration (HTTP and HTTPS) determines how many licenses are retained when rendering webforms. With the appropriate configuration, you can avoid unnecessary license retaining.

As explained in the [configuration](#configuration) section, the WebAdmin web server provides a secured web access to Qodly Studio. On the other hand, the [renderer](#rendering-webforms) communicates with the 4D web server of the database using REST requests. As such, it behaves like a conventional 4D Client.

If you run the renderer from the Qodly Studio and these two web servers are not reached through the same URL scheme (HTTP or HTTPS), it might lead to wrong licence counting.

#### Exemple

1. You run the Qodly Studio on an HTTPS URL scheme (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:7443/studio/`)

2. The web server of your database is started only on an HTTP port.

![alt-text](../assets/en/WebServer/schemes.png)

3. In Qodly Studio, you click on the **rendering** icon. You are warned that the two web servers are started on different schemes, but despite this you click on the **Confirm** button.

![alt-text](../assets/en/WebServer/render-button.png)

As a result, two licenses are retained.

:::note

You can enable/disable the display of the renderer pop over using a Qodly Studio user setting.

:::

### SameSite attribute

The behavior previously described is due to the session cookie of the 4D web server. This session cookie has a `SameSite` attribute that determines if the session cookie is sent to the web server.

If the `SameSite` attribute's value is `Strict` (default), the session cookie is not sent to the web server, so a new session is opened each time a page is rendered or refreshed.

For more information on the `SameSite` attribute, check out [this blog post](https://blog.4d.com/get-ready-for-the-new-SameSite-and-secure-attributes-for-cookies/).

### Recommendations

To avoid using more licenses than necessary, we recommend doing one of the following:

- Run the renderer on another browser tab (by entering the rendered URL of your Web form: `IP:port/$lib/renderer/?w=WebFormName`).
- Ensure the Qodly Studio and your database are reached on the same URL scheme.
- Use the `Lax` value for the [session cookie](webServerConfig.md#session-cookie-samesite) of your project database's web server.
