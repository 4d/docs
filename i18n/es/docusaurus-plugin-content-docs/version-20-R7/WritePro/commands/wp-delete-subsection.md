#### Descripción

The **WP DELETE SUBSECTION** command <!--REF #_command_.WP DELETE SUBSECTION.Summary-->removes the *subSectionType* subsection elements from the *wpSection* 4D Write Pro section, or it directly removes the passed *subSection*<!-- END REF-->. Subsection elements include headers, footers, columns, anchored pictures, etc. Note that the body of the document is left untouched.

In *wpSection*, pass the section from which you want to remove the subsection elements. The section can be obtained using the [WP Get sections](../commands-legacy/wp-get-sections.md) or [WP Get section](../commands-legacy/wp-get-section.md) commands.

The *subSectionType* parameter specifes the subsection to delete. You can pass one of the following constants:

| Constante     | Tipo    | Valor |
| ------------- | ------- | ----- |
| wk first page | Longint | 1     |
| wk left page  | Longint | 2     |
| wk right page | Longint | 3     |

:::note

Deleting a left page or right page subsection will automatically delete the opposite subsection. For example, if you delete a right page subsection, the left page subsection is automatically deleted.

:::

If the *subSectionType* does not exist, the command does nothing (no error is generated).

:::note

When a subsection is deleted, the header and footer are removed, as well as anchored pictures and textboxes but the body remains untouched.

:::

#### Ejemplo 1

You want to delete the first page subsection of the first section:

```4d
 var $section;$subsection : Object
  // get first section
 $section:=WP Get section(wpDoc;1)
  // Delete the subsection
 WP DELETE SUBSECTION($section;wk first page)
```

#### Ejemplo 2

You want to delete the right page subsection of section 3:

```4d

$subSection:=WP Get subsection(WP Get section($document;3);wk right page)
 WP DELETE SUBSECTION($subSection)
 
```
