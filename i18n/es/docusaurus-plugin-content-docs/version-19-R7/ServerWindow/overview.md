When 4D Server is launched with interface under Windows or macOS, a graphical administration window is available, providing many analysis and control tools for the published 4D application. To display the 4D Server Administration window for the opened project, select the **Window > Administration** menu item, or press **Ctrl+U**.

> The 4D Server administration window can be accessed from a remote 4D. For more information about this point, please refer to Administration from Remote Machines.
