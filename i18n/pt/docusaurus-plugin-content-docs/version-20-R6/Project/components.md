A 4D component is a set of 4D code and/or 4D forms representing one or more functionalities that you can add and use in your projects. For example, the [4D SVG](https://github.com/4d/4D-SVG) component adds advanced commands and an integrated rendering engine that can be used to display SVG files.

You can [develop](../Extensions/develop-components.md) and [build](../Desktop/building.md) your own 4D components, or download public components shared by the 4D community that [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=4d-component\&type=Repositories).

When developing in 4D, the component files can be transparently stored in your computer or on a Github repository.

## Interpreted and compiled components

Components can be interpreted or [compiled](../Desktop/building.md). The package folder of a component can contain:

- either a Project folder (interpreted component)
- or a .4DZ file (compiled component)

A 4D project running in interpreted mode can use either interpreted or compiled components. A 4D project running in compiled mode cannot use interpreted components. Por isso não pode ser usado em um componente.

## Loading components

:::note

This page describes how to work with components in the **4D** and **4D Server** environments. In other environments, components are managed differently:

- in [4D in remote mode](../Desktop/clientServer.md), components are loaded by the server and sent to the remote application.
- in merged applications, components are [included at the build step](../Desktop/building.md#plugins--components-page).

:::

### Visão Geral

To load a component in your 4D project, you can either:

- copy the component files in the [**Components** folder of your project](architecture.md#components),
- or, declare the component in the **dependencies.json** file.

Components declared in the **dependencies.json** file can be stored at different locations:

- at the same level as your 4D project's package folder: this is the default location,
- anywhere on your machine: the component path must be declared in the **environment4d.json** file
- on a GitHub repository: the component path can be declared in the **dependencies.json** file or in the **environment4d.json** file, or in both files.

If the same component is installed at different locations, a [priority order](#priority) is applied.

### dependencies.json vs environment4d.json

#### dependencies.json

The **dependencies.json** file references all components required in your 4D project. This file must be located in the **Sources** folder of the 4D project folder, e.g.:

```
	/MyProjectRoot/Project/Sources/dependencies.json
```

It can contain:

- names of components [stored locally](#declaring-local-components) (default path or path defined in an **environment4d.json** file),
- names of components [stored on GitHub repositories](#declaring-components-stored-on-github) (their path can be defined in this file or in an **environment4d.json** file).

#### environment4d.json

The **environment4d.json** file is optional. It allows you to define **custom paths** for some or all components declared in the **dependencies.json** file. This file can be stored in your project package folder or in one of its parent folders, at any level (up to the root).

The main benefits of this architecture are the following:

- you can store the **environment4d.json** file in a parent folder of your projects and decide not to commit it, allowing you to have your local component organization.
- if you want to use the same GitHub repository for several of your projects, you can reference it in the **environment4d.json** file and declare it in the **dependencies.json** file.

### Prioridade

Since components can be installed in different ways, a priority order is applied when the same component is referenced at several locations:

**Higest priority**

1. Components stored in the [**Components** folder of the project](architecture.md#components).
2. Components declared in the **dependencies.json** file.
3. Internal User 4D components (e.g. 4D NetKit, 4D SVG...)

**Lowest priority**

![priority](../assets/en/Project/load-sequence.png)

When a component cannot be loaded because of another instance of the same component located at a higher priority level, it is given the _Overloaded_ [status](#dependency-status). The loaded component has the _Overloading_ [status](#dependency-status).

(the **environment4d.json** declared path overrides the **dependencies.json** path to configure a local environment).

### Declaring local components

You declare a local component in the [**dependencies.json** file](#dependencyjson) in the following way:

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "myComponent1" : {},
        "myComponent2" : {}
    }
}
```

... where "myComponent1" and "myComponent2" are the name of the components to be loaded.

By default, if "myComponent1" and "myComponent2" are not declared in an [environment4d.json file](#environment4djson), 4D will look for the component's package folder (_i.e._ the project root folder of the component) at the same level as your 4D project's package folder, e.g.:

```
	/MyProjectRoot/
	/MyProjectComponentRoot/
```

Thanks to this architecture, you can simply copy all your components at the same level as your projects and reference them in your **dependencies.json** files.

:::note

If you do not want to benefit from the **dependencies.json** architecture, you can install local components by copying their files in the [**Components** folder of your project](architecture.md#components).

:::

#### Customizing component paths

If you want to customize the location of local components, you declare the paths for the dependencies that are not stored at the same level as the project folder in the [**environment4d.json**](#environment4djson) file.

You can use absolute or relative paths, expressed in POSIX syntax as described in [this paragraph](../Concepts/paths#posix-syntax). Relative paths are relative to the environment4d.json file.

Exemplos:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"myComponent1" : "MyComponent1",
		"myComponent2" : "../MyComponent2",
        "myComponent3" : "file:///Users/jean/MyComponent3"
    }
}
```

:::note

If a component path declared in the **environment4d.json** file is not found when the project is started, the component is not loaded and gets the _Not found_ [status](dependency-status), even if a version of the component exists next to the project's package folder.

:::

### Declaring components stored on GitHub

4D components available as GitHub releases can be referenced and automatically loaded in your 4D projects.

:::note

Regarding components stored on GitHub, both [**dependencies.json**](#dependenciesjson) and [**environment4d.json**](#environment4djson) files support the same contents.

:::

#### Configuring the GitHub repository

To be able to directly reference and use a 4D component stored on GitHub, you need to configure the GitHub component's repository:

- Compress the component files in ZIP format.
- Name this archive with the same name as the GitHub repository.
- Integrate the archive into a [GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) of the repository.

These steps can easily be automated, with 4D code or using GitHub Actions, for example.

#### Declaring paths

You declare a component stored on GitHub in the [**dependencies.json** file](#dependencyjson) in the following way:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"myGitHubComponent1": {
			"github" : "JohnSmith/myGitHubComponent1"
		},
		"myGitHubComponent2": {}
	}
}
```

... where "myGitHubComponent1" is referenced and declared for the project, although "myGitHubComponent2" is only referenced. You need to declare it in the [**environment4d.json**](#environment4djson) file:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"myGitHubComponent2": {
			"github" : "JohnSmith/myGitHubComponent2"
		}
	}
}
```

"myGitHubComponent2" can be used by several projects.

#### Tags and versions

When you create a release in GitHub, you specify a **tag** and a **version**.

- **Tags** are texts that uniquely reference a release. In the [**dependencies.json** file](#dependencyjson) and [**environment4d.json**](#environment4djson) files, you can indicate the release tag you want to use in your project. For example :

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"myFirstGitHubComponent": {
			"github": "JohnSmith/myFirstGitHubComponent",
			"tag": "beta2"
		}
	}
}
```

- A release is also identified by a **version**. The versioning system used is based on the _Semantic Versioning_ concept, which is the most commonly used. Each version number is identified as follows: `majorNumber.minorNumber.pathNumber`. In the same way as for tags, you can indicate the version of the component you wish to use in your project, as in this example:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"myFirstGitHubComponent": {
			"github": "JohnSmith/myFirstGitHubComponent",
			"version": "2.1.3"
		}
	}
}
```

The version is used to define which versions can be used. A [standard semantic version](https://regex101.com/r/Ly7O1x/3/) is used. A range is defined by two semantic versions, a min and a max, with operators '\< | > | >= | <= | ='. The `*` can be used as a placeholder for all versions. ~ and ^ prefixes define versions starting at a number, and up to respectively the next major and minor version.

Here are a few examples:

- "latest": the version having the “latest” badge in GitHub releases.
- "\*": the latest version released.
- "1.\*": all version of major version 1.
- "1.2.\*": all patches of minor version 1.2.
- "^1.2.3" or ">=1.2.3": the latest version 1, starting with the 1.2.3 version.
- "~1.2.3" or ">1.2.3": the latest major version 1, starting with the version just after the 1.2.3.
- "<=1.2.3": the latest version until the 1.2.3 one.
- "1.0.0 – 1.2.3" or ">=1.0.0 <=1.2.3": version between 1.0.0 and 1.2.3.
- "`<1.2.3 || >=2`": version that is not between 1.2.3 and 2.0.0.

If you do not specify a tag or a version, 4D automatically retrieves the "latest" version.

#### Private repositories

If you want to integrate a component located in a private repository, you need to tell 4D to use a connection token to access it.

To do this, in your GitHub account, create a **classic** token with access rights to **repo**.

:::note

For more information, please refer to the [GitHub token interface](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

:::

Then insert the "github" key in your [**environment4d.json**](#environment4djson) file:

```json
{
	"github": {
		"token": "ghpXXXXXXXXXXXXUvW8x9yZ"
	},
	"dependencies": {

		"mySecondGitHubComponent": {
			"github": "JohnSmith/mySecondGitHubComponent"
		}
	}
}
```

#### Local cache for dependencies

Referenced GitHub components are downloaded in a local cache folder then loaded in your environment. The local cache folder is stored at the following location:

- on macOs: `$HOME/Library/Caches/<app name>/Dependencies`
- on Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<app name>\Dependencies`

...where `<app name>` can be "4D", "4D Server", or "tool4D".

#### dependency-lock.json

A `dependency-lock.json` file is created in the [`userPreferences` folder](architecture.md#userpreferencesusername) of your project.

This file logs information such as the state of dependencies, paths, urls, loading errors, as well as other information. It could be useful for component loading management or troubleshooting.

## Monitoring Project Dependencies

In an opened project, you can get information about dependencies and their current loading status in the **Dependencies** panel.

To display the Dependencies panel:

- with 4D, select the **Design/Project Dependencies** menu item (Development environment),<br/>
  ![dependency-menu](../assets/en/Project/dependency-menu.png)

- with 4D Server, select the **Window/Project Dependencies** menu item.<br/>
  ![dependency-menu-server](../assets/en/Project/dependency-menu-server.png)

The Dependency panel is then displayed. Dependencies are sorted by name in alphabetical order:

![dependency](../assets/en/Project/dependency.png)

### Origem da dependência

The Dependencies panel lists all project dependencies, whatever their origin, i.e. wherever they come from. The dependency origin is provided by the tag under its name:

![dependency-origin](../assets/en/Project/dependency-origin.png)

The following origins are possible:

| Origin tag                        | Descrição                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Componente 4D                     | Built-in 4D component, stored in the `Components` folder of the 4D application |
| dependencies.json | Component declared in the [`dependencies.json`](#dependenciesjson) file        |
| Environment                       | Component declared in the [`environnement4d.json`](#environment4djson) file    |
| Componente do projeto             | Component located in the [`Components`](architecture.md#components) folder     |

**Right-click** in a dependency line and select **Show on disk** to reveal the location of a dependency:

![dependency-show](../assets/en/Project/dependency-show.png)

:::note

This item is not displayed if the dependency is inactive because its files are not found.

:::

Component icon and location logo provide additional information:

- The component logo indicates if it is provided by 4D or a third-party developer.
- Local components can be differentiated from GitHub components by a small icon.

![dependency-origin](../assets/en/Project/dependency-github.png)

### Filtering Dependencies

By default, all dependencies identified by the Dependency manager are listed, whatever their [status](#dependency-status). You can filter the displayed dependencies according to their status by selecting the appropriate tab at the top of the Dependencies panel:

![dependency-tabs](../assets/en/Project/dependency-tabs.png)

- **Active**: Dependencies that are loaded and can be used in the project. It includes _overloading_ dependencies, which are actually loaded. _Overloaded_ dependencies are listed in the **Conflicts** panel, along with all conflicting dependencies.
- **Inactive**: Dependencies that are not loaded in the project and are not available. There are many possible reasons for this status: missing files, version incompatibility...
- **Conflict**: Dependencies that are loaded but that overloads at least one other dependency at lower [priority level](#priority). Overloaded dependencies are also displayed so that you can check the origin of the conflict and take appropriate actions.

### Status de dependência

Dependencies requiring the developer's attention are indicated by a **status label** at the right side of the line and a specific background color:

![dependency-status](../assets/en/Project/dependency-conflict2.png)

The following status labels are available:

- **Overloaded**: The dependency is not loaded because it is overloaded by another dependency with the same name at a higher [priority level](#priority).
- **Overloading**: The dependency is loaded and is overloading one or more other dependencies with the same name at a lower [priority level](#priority).
- **Not found**: The dependency is declared in the dependencies.json file but is not found.
- **Inactive**: The dependency is not loaded because it is not compatible with the project (e.g. the component is not compiled for the current platform).
- **Duplicated**: The dependency is not loaded because another dependency with the same name exists at the same location (and is loaded).

A tooltip is displayed when you hover over the dependency line, provding additional information about the status:

![dependency-tips](../assets/en/Project/dependency-tip1.png)
