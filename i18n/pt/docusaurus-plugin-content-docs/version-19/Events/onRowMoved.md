| 34   | [List Box of the array type](FormObjects/listbox_overview.md#array-list-boxes) - [List Box Column](FormObjects/listbox_overview.md#list-box-columns) | A list box row is moved by the user via drag and drop |


## Descrção

This event is generated when a row of the list box ([array type only](FormObjects/listbox_overview.md#array-list-boxes)) is moved by the user using drag and drop ([if allowed](FormObjects/properties_Action.md#movable-rows). It is not generated if the row is dragged and then dropped in its initial location.

The `LISTBOX MOVED ROW NUMBER` command returns the new position of the row.
