You can use the Backup page to view some backup parameters of the database and to launch a manual backup:

![](../assets/en/MSC/msc_Backup.png)

This page consists of the following three areas:

- **Backup File Destination**: displays information about the location of the database backup file. It also indicates the free/used space on the backup disk.
- **Last Backup Information**: provides the date and time of the last backup (automatic or manual) carried out on the database.
- **Contents of the backup file**: lists the files and folders included in the backup file.

The **Backup** button is used to launch a manual backup.

This page cannot be used to modify the backup parameters. To do this, you must click on the **Database properties...** button.
