title: Debugging from remote machines
---

## VisÃ£o Geral

When a 4D database is running on 4D Server in interpreted mode, you can debug the 4D code running on the server from a remote 4D client logged to the project. You just need to attach the debugger to a specific remote machine, and the code execution can be monitored in the debugger directly on the remote machine.

On a remote machine, the [debugger window](debugger.md) displays a specific server icon and a blue background color to indicate that you are debugging server code:

![debugger-window-remote](../assets/en/Debugging/debuggerWindowRemote.png)

This feature is particularly useful when 4D Server runs in headless mode (see [Command Line Interface](../Admin/cli.md)), or when access to the server machine is not easy.


## Depurador anexado

Only one debugger can debug a 4D Server application at a given time. It is called the **attached debugger**. The attached debugger can be:

* the local 4D Server debugger (default) - if the server is not running headless.
* the debugger of a remote 4D client - if the remote session has access to Design mode.

The attached debugger is called whenever a 4D Server encounters:
* um ponto de ruptura
* a `TRACE` command
* a caught command
* um erro

Keep in mind that error messages are sent to the attached debugger machine. This means that in the case of a remote debugger, server error messages are displayed on the remote 4D client.

Note que:
* The code executed in the `On Server Startup Database` Method cannot be debugged remotely. It can only be debugged on the server side
* If no debugger is attached, the running code is not stopped by debugging commands


## Ligar o depurador

By default when you start an interpreted application:

* if 4D Server is not running headless, the debugger is attached to the server,
* if 4D Server is running headless, no debugger is attached.

You can attach the debugger to any remote 4D client allowed to connect to the 4D Server application.

> The remote 4D client's user session must have access to the Design environment of the database.

To attach the debugger to a remote 4D client:

1. In the 4D Server menu bar, select **Edit** > **Detach Debugger** so that the debugger becomes available to remote machines (this step is useless if the 4D Server is running headless).
2. In a remote 4D client connected to the server, select **Run** > **Attach Remote Debugger**

If the attachment is accepted (see [Rejected attachment requests](#rejected-attachment-requests)), the menu command becomes **Detach Remote Debugger**.

The debugger is then attached to the remote 4D client:
* until the end of the user session
* until you select `Detach Remote Debugger`

To attach the debugger back to the server:

1. On the remote 4D client that has the debugger attached, select **Run** > **Detach Remote Debugger**.
2. In the 4D Server menu bar, select **Edit** > **Attach debugger**.

> When the debugger is attached to the server (default), all server processes are automatically executed in cooperative mode to enable debugging. This can have a significant impact on performance. When you don't need to debug on the server machine, it is recommended to detach the debugger and attach it to a remote machine if necessary.



## Attaching debugger at startup

4D allows you to automatically attach the debugger to a remote 4D client or the server at startup:

* On the server (if not headless), this option is named **Attach Debugger At Startup**. When the server is started, it automatically attaches the debugger (default).

> **Warning**: If this option is selected for a server which is subsequently launched in headless mode, the debugger won't be available for this server.

* On a remote 4D client, this option is named **Attach Remote Debugger At Startup**. When selected, the remote 4D client will automatically try to attach the remote debugger at each subsequent connection to the same 4D Server database. If the attachment is accepted (see [Rejected attachment requests](#rejected-attachment-requests)), the remote debugger is automatically attached to the remote 4D client and the **Detach Remote Debugger option is displayed**.

> This setting is applied per project and is stored locally in the [`.4DPreferences`](Project/architecture.md#userpreferencesusername) file.

## Rejected attachment requests

While the debugger is already attached to a remote 4D client or to 4D Server, no other machine can attach the debugger.

If a machine tries to attach the debugger while it is already attached, the attachment is rejected and a dialog box appears:

![attach-debugger-dialog](../assets/en/Debugging/attach-debugger-dialog.png)

![attach-debugger-dialog-2](../assets/en/Debugging/attach-debugger-dialog-2.png)

Attaching the debugger in this case requires that:

* the attached debugger is detached from the server or from the remote 4D client using respectively the **Detach debugger** or **Detach remote debugger** menu command,
* the attached remote 4D client session is closed.
