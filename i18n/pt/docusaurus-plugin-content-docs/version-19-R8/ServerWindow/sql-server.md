The upper part of the page provides information about the current status of the SQL server of 4D Server.

- **State**: Started or Stopped
- **Starting time**: Date and time the SQL server was last launched.
- **Uptime**: Time elapsed since last startup of the SQL server.

## Start / Stop SQL Server

This button toggles and can be used to control the activation of the 4D Server SQL server.

- When the SQL server state is "Started," the button is titled **Stop SQL Server**. If you click on this button, the 4D Server SQL server is immediately stopped; it no longer replies to any external SQL requests received on the designated TCP port.
- When the SQL server state is "Stopped," the button is titled **Start SQL Server**. If you click on this button, the 4D Server SQL server is immediately started; it replies to any external SQL queries received on the designated TCP port. Note that you will need a suitable license to be able to use the 4D SQL server.

> The SQL server can also be launched automatically on application startup (option in the Settings) or by programming.
