#### Descrição

The **WP DELETE SECTION** command <!--REF #_command_.WP DELETE SECTION.Summary-->deletes the passed *section* object, or deletes one or more sections starting at  *indexNumber* and depending on the *count* passed<!-- END REF-->. When a section is removed, everything associated with it, including the header, footer, part of the body, anchored pictures, text boxes, and the ending section break (whether a section break or continuous section break), is also removed.

An error is raised if the **WP DELETE SECTION** command requests to delete all sections or if the document contains only one section.

**WP DELETE SECTION** re-indexes the anchorSection attribute of text boxes and pictures to adjust their anchors to their sections after changes. For example, if a document has four sections and the second section is deleted, sections 3 and 4 will become sections 2 and 3 and text boxes and pictures that were previously anchored to sections 3 and 4 will now be anchored to sections 2 and 3.

:::note

If an image or textbox is anchored to a page (e.g., page 20) and this page no longer exists after a section has been deleted, the image (or textbox) will remain in the document and will reappear on page 20 if this page ever exists again later.

#### Exemplos

To remove the first section of the document:

```4d

wpDoc:=WP Import document("test.wp")
// remove section 1 only (without error unless there is only one section in the document)
WP DELETE SECTION(wpDoc ; 1) 

```

To remove section 5 of the document:

```4d

wpDoc:=WP Import document("test.wp")
// remove section 5 only
WP DELETE SECTION(wpDoc ; 5)

```

To remove section 5, 6 and 7 of the document:

```4d
 
wpDoc:=WP Import document("test.wp")
WP DELETE SECTION(wpDoc ; 5 ; 3 )

```

To remove all sections starting from 5:

```4d
 
wpDoc:=WP Import document("test.wp")
// remove all sections starting at section 5 (without error unless section 5 does not exist)
WP DELETE SECTION(wpDoc ; 5 ; MAXLONG )

```

To retrieve and remove section 5:

```4d
 
wpDoc:=WP Import document("test.wp")
// get section 5
$section:=WP Get section(wpDoc, 5)
// remove $section
WP DELETE SECTION($section)

```
